To take full advantage of these technologies, you need to know how to use them. Below you'll find links to our Web technology documentation.\n\n## Documentation for Web developers\n\n- [Web developer guides](/blog/Es Solution/Guides)\n  - : The Web Developer Guides provide practical, how-to content to help you use Web technologies for your goals or needs.\n- [Tutorials for Web developers](/blog/Es Solution/Tutorials)\n  - : Tutorials to take you step-by-step through learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs.\n- [Accessibility](/blog/Web/Accessibility)\n  - : Enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.\n- [Performance](/blog/Web/Performance)\n  - : Making content as available and interactive as possible, as soon as possible.\n- [Privacy](/blog/Web/Privacy)\n  - : Protecting users' personal data.\n- [Security](/blog/Web/Security)\n  - : Protecting users from data leaks and data theft, side-channel attacks, and attacks such as cross-site scripting, content injection, and click-jacking.\n- [Glossary](/blog/Glossary)\n  - : Definitions of Web-related terms.\n\n## Web technology references\n\n- [Web APIs](/blog/Web/API)\n  - : JavaScript programming APIs you can use to build apps on the Web.\n- [HTML](/blog/Web/HTML)\n  - : HTML provides the fundamental building blocks for structuring Web documents and apps.\n- [CSS](/blog/Web/CSS)\n  - : Cascading Style Sheets are used to describe the appearance of Web documents and apps.\n- [JavaScript](/blog/Web/JavaScript)\n  - : JavaScript is the Web's native programming language.\n- [WebAssembly](/blog/WebAssembly)\n  - : WebAssembly allows programs written in C, C++, Rust, Swift, C#, Go, and more to run on the Web.\n- [Events](/blog/Web/Events)\n  - : Events are what you build Web apps to react to; for example, when a Web page finishes loading, or a user selects something, presses a key, resizes a window, submits a form, or pauses a video.\n- [HTTP](/blog/Web/HTTP)\n  - : HTTP is the fundamental Internet protocol for fetching documents, stylesheets, scripts, images, videos, fonts, and other resources over the Web — and for sending data back to Web servers.\n- [Media](/blog/Web/Media)\n  - : Formats, codecs, protocols, APIs, and techniques for embedding and streaming video, audio, and image content in Web documents and apps.\n- [SVG](/blog/Web/SVG)\n  - : Scalable Vector Graphics lets you create images that scale smoothly to any size.\n- [MathML](/blog/Web/MathML)\n  - : MathML lets you display complex mathematical notation on the Web.\n- [URI](/blog/Web/URI)\n  - : Uniform Resource Identifiers are used by various technologies, including the browser itself via the address bar, to identify resources in various ways.\n- [WebDriver](/blog/Web/WebDriver)\n  - : WebDriver is a browser-automation mechanism for remotely controlling a browser by emulating the actions of a real person using the browser. It's widely used for cross-browser testing of Web apps.\n- [Web Extensions](/blog/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)\n  - : Web Extensions are a way for you to give users enhanced capabilities in their browsers — for doing things such as blocking ads and other content, customizing the appearance of pages, and more.\n- [Web App Manifests](/blog/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest)\n  - : Web App Manifests let you enable users to install Web apps to their device home screens, with aspects such as portrait/landscape screen orientation and display mode (e.g., full screen) pre-set.\n- [Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](/blog/Web/Progressive_web_apps)\n  - : Progressive Web Apps provide a user experience similar to native mobile apps.\n- [OpenSearch](/blog/Web/XML/Guides/OpenSearch)\n  - : OpenSearch allows a website to describe a search engine for itself, so that a browser or other client application can use that search engine.\n- [XML](/blog/Web/XML)\n  - : The Extensible Markup Language is a strict serialization of the [Document Object Model](/blog/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).\n- [XSLT](/blog/Web/XML/XSLT)\n  - : Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations is an [XML](/blog/Web/XML/Guides/XML_introduction)-based language used, in conjunction with specialized processing software, for the transformation of XML documents.\n- [XPath](/blog/Web/XML/XPath)\n  - : XPath uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing (pointing to) different parts of an [XML](/blog/Web/XML/Guides/XML_introduction) document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document to determine whether they match a pattern or not.\n- [EXSLT](/blog/Web/XML/EXSLT)\n  - : EXSLT a set of extensions to [XSLT](/blog/Web/XML/XSLT).\n\n## Developer tools documentation\n\n- [Firefox Developer Tools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html)\n  - : Documentation for the set of web-developer tools built into Firefox.\n- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)\n  - : Documentation for the set of web-developer tools built into Chrome.\n- [Safari Web Inspector](https://webkit.org/web-inspector/)\n  - : Documentation for the set of web-developer tools built into Safari.\n- [Edge DevTools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/landing/)\n  - : Documentation for the set of web-developer tools built into Edge.\n","slug":"3b54f170008a484980b36301ff41e930","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-06T21:21:35.133Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-06T21:21:35.149Z","layout":"PostLayout"}

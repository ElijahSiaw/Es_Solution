{"title":"Using Comments in HTML","tag":"web/html/guides/comments","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"web/html\")}}\n\nAn HTML **comment** is used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.\n\nComments start with the string `<!--` and end with the string `-->`, generally with text in between. This text cannot start with the string `>` or `->`, cannot contain the strings `-->` or `--!>`, nor end with the string `<!-`, though `<!` is allowed.\n\nThe browser ignores comments as it renders the code. In other words, they are not visible on the page - just in the code. HTML comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about your code or logic.\n\nThe above is true for [XML](/blog/Web/XML) comments as well. In addition, in XML, such as in [SVG](/blog/Web/SVG) or [MathML](/blog/Web/MathML) markup, a comment cannot contain the character sequence `--`.\n\nComments can be used on a single line, or span multiple lines. They can be used in the following places:\n\n- Before and after the {{Glossary(\"Doctype\")}}\n- Before and after the {{HTMLElement(\"html\")}} element\n- As the content of most elements except: {{HTMLElement(\"script\")}}, {{HTMLElement(\"style\")}}, {{HTMLElement(\"title\")}}, {{HTMLElement(\"textarea\")}}, because these elements interpret their content as raw text\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> While `<script>` elements should not have HTML comments and should use [JavaScript comments](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#comments) instead, there was a legacy practice to enclose the whole script content in an HTML comment so ancient browsers that don't support JavaScript don't render it as text. This is now a [legacy feature of JavaScript itself](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Deprecated_and_obsolete_features#html_comments) and you should not rely on it.\n\n## Syntax\n\n```html\n<!-- Comment -->\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```html\n<!-- A one-line comment -->\n\n<!--\nA comment\nthat stretches\nover several\nlines\n-->\n\n<!-- The comment below disables\n   the HTML contained within -->\n<!--\n<p>\n   This content will not be rendered.\n</p>\n-->\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nHTML comments are only permitted as content. You cannot use it within a tag, such as before an HTML [attribute](/blog/Glossary/Attribute).\n\nAs with most programming languages that use the `<!-- -->` comment syntax, comments cannot be nested. In other words, the first instance of `-->` that follows an instance of `<!--` closes the comment.\n\nWhile comments do start with a `<` and end in a `>`, a comment is not an HTML element.\n\n## Specifications\n\n{{Specifications}}\n\n## See also\n\n- [Comments in JavaScript](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#comments)\n- [Comments in CSS](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/Comments)\n- {{domxref(\"Comment\")}} API (`Comment` inherits from {{domxref(\"Node\")}})\n","slug":"4f0255c3bd0642f99eaf9456809c2fa4","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-06T11:19:37.007Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-06T11:19:37.008Z","layout":"PostSimple"}

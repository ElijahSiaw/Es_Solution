{"title":"HTML attribute: Preconnect","tag":"web/html/reference/attributes/rel/preconnect","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"web/html/reference/attributes\")}}\n\nThe **`preconnect`** keyword for the [`rel`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/link#rel) attribute of the {{HTMLElement(\"link\")}} element is a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user experience by preemptively initiating a connection to that origin. Preconnecting speeds up future loads from a given origin by preemptively performing part or all of the handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins).\n\n`<link rel=\"preconnect\">` will provide a benefit to any future cross-origin HTTP request, navigation or subresource. It has no benefit on same-origin requests because the connection is already open.\n\nIf a page needs to make connections to many third-party domains, preconnecting them all can be counterproductive. The `<link rel=\"preconnect\">` hint is best used for only the most critical connections. For the others, just use [`<link rel=\"dns-prefetch\">`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/dns-prefetch) to save time on the first step â€” the DNS lookup.\n\n## Examples\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://example.com\" />\n```\n\nYou can also implement preconnect as an HTTP [`Link`](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Link) header, for example:\n\n```http\nLink: <https://example.com>; rel=\"preconnect\"\n```\n\n## Specifications\n\n{{Specifications}}\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n{{Compat}}\n\n## See also\n\n- [Speculative loading](/blog/Web/Performance/Guides/Speculative_loading) for a comparison of `<link rel=\"preconnect\">` and other similar performance improvement features.\n","slug":"d584b9d63eaf417884d1d246c7424fee","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-06T10:27:02.442Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-06T10:27:02.442Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

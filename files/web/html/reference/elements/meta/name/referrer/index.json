{"title":"Referrer","tag":"html/reference/elements/meta/name/referrer","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"html/reference/elements\")}}\n\nThe **`referrer`** value for the [`name`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute of the {{htmlelement(\"meta\")}} element controls the HTTP {{httpheader(\"Referer\")}} header of requests sent from the document.\nIf specified, you define the referrer using a [`content`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content) attribute in the `<meta>` element as a keyword value.\n\nFor example, the following `<meta>` element sends the {{glossary(\"origin\")}} of the document as the referrer:\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"referrer\" content=\"origin\" />\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Dynamically inserting `<meta name=\"referrer\">` (with {{domxref(\"Document.write\", \"document.write()\")}} or {{domxref(\"Node.appendChild\", \"appendChild()\")}}) makes the referrer behavior unpredictable.\n> When several conflicting policies are defined, the `no-referrer` policy is applied.\n\n## Usage notes\n\nA `<meta name=\"referrer\">` element has the following additional attributes:\n\n- [`content`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content)\n  - : Sets the document referrer. You must define this attribute.\n    Accepts one of the following values:\n    - `no-referrer`\n      - : Does not send an HTTP `Referer` header.\n    - `origin`\n      - : Sends the origin of the document.\n    - `no-referrer-when-downgrade`\n      - : Sends the full URL when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but sends no referrer when it's less secure (HTTPS→HTTP). This is the default behavior.\n    - `origin-when-cross-origin`\n      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests, but only sends the origin for other cases.\n    - `same-origin`\n      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests. Cross-origin requests will contain no referrer header.\n    - `strict-origin`\n      - : Sends the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but sends no referrer when it's less secure (HTTPS→HTTP).\n    - `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`\n      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests. Sends the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS). Otherwise, sends no referrer.\n    - `unsafe-URL`\n      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin or cross-origin requests.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Removing a referrer from requests\n\nThe following `<meta>` element specifies that the document shouldn't send a `Referer` header with HTTP requests from the document:\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"referrer\" content=\"no-referrer\" />\n```\n\n## Specifications\n\n{{Specifications}}\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n{{Compat}}\n\n## See also\n\n- HTTP {{httpheader(\"Referer\")}} header\n","slug":"81898d210e064ec083c6298311cb0933","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T19:06:11.401Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T19:06:11.401Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

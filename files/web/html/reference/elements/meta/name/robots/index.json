{"title":"Robots","tag":"html/reference/elements/meta/name/robots","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"html/reference/elements\")}}\n\nThe **`robots`** value for the [`name`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute of the {{htmlelement(\"meta\")}} element defines the crawl behavior that cooperative crawlers (or \"robots\") should use with the page.\nIf specified, you define crawl directives using a [`content`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content) attribute in the `<meta>` element as a comma-separated list of one or more rules.\n\nFor example, to hint to crawlers that a page should be excluded from their search indexes, a `noindex` value can be used:\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\" />\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Only cooperative robots follow these rules.\n> A crawler still needs to access the resource to read headers and meta elements (see [X-Robots-Tag: Interaction with robots.txt](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Robots-Tag#interaction_with_robots.txt)).\n> If you want to prevent bandwidth consumption by crawlers, a restrictive {{Glossary(\"robots.txt\")}} file is more effective than indexing rules as it blocks resources from being crawled entirely.\n\n## Usage notes\n\nA `<meta name=\"robots\">` element can have the following additional attributes:\n\n- [`content`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content)\n  - : The `content` attribute must be defined, and its value sets indexing and crawling behavior for cooperative search engine robots.\n    Accepts one or more of the following keywords as a comma-separated list:\n    - `index`\n      - : Allows the robot to index the page. This is the default behavior.\n        Used by all major crawlers.\n    - `noindex`\n      - : Requests the robot not to index the page.\n        Used by all major crawlers.\n    - `follow`\n      - : Allows the robot to follow links on the page. This is the default behavior.\n        Used by all major crawlers.\n    - `nofollow`\n      - : Requests the robot not to follow the links on the page.\n        Used by all major crawlers.\n    - `all`\n      - : Equivalent to `index, follow`.\n        Used by: [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags?visit_id=637855965067987211-415685194&rd=1).\n    - `none`\n      - : Equivalent to `noindex, nofollow`.\n        Used by: [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags?visit_id=637855965074074862-574753619&rd=1).\n    - `noarchive`\n      - : Requests that the search engine not cache the page content.\n        Used by: [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag), [Yahoo](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/search-for-desktop/SLN2213.html), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/which-robots-metatags-does-bing-support-5198d240).\n    - `nosnippet`\n      - : Prevents displaying any description of the page in search engine results.\n        Used by: [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/which-robots-metatags-does-bing-support-5198d240).\n    - `noimageindex`\n      - : Requests that this page not appear as the referring page of an indexed image.\n        Used by: [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag).\n    - `nocache`\n      - : Synonym of `noarchive`.\n        Used by: [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/which-robots-metatags-does-bing-support-5198d240).\n\n## Description\n\nThere are several important considerations to note when setting a `robots` meta value:\n\n- Only cooperative robots follow these rules. They won't prevent malicious actors like email harvesters from ignoring the directives.\n- If defined in a `<meta>` tag, robots still need to access the page to read these rules. To reduce bandwidth, consider using a [robots.txt file](/blog/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Robots_txt) instead.\n- The `<meta name=\"robots\">` tag and `robots.txt` serve different roles: `robots.txt` controls crawling, while the `robots` meta tag influences indexing and other behavior.\n- A page blocked by `robots.txt` may still be indexed if linked from other sources.\n- The `noindex` directive will only take effect after the robot revisits the page, so ensure `robots.txt` doesn't prevent this.\n- Some values, such as `index` vs. `noindex` or `follow` vs. `nofollow`, are mutually exclusive. Behavior is undefined when conflicting values are used.\n- Robots like Google, Yahoo, and Bing also support these directives in the HTTP header {{HTTPHeader(\"X-Robots-Tag\")}}, which is useful for non-HTML content such as PDFs or images.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Using a robots keyword\n\nThe following example uses `nofollow` to request that a crawler doesn't follow links on a page and `noindex` to request that the page is excluded from indexing:\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"nofollow, noindex\" />\n```\n\n## Specifications\n\nWhile not part of any specification, it is a de-facto standard method for communicating with search bots, web crawlers, and similar user agents.\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\nThis feature is intended for crawlers to observe, so \"browser\" compatibility doesn't apply.\n\n## See also\n\n- {{httpheader(\"X-Robots-Tag\")}} HTTP header\n- [robots.txt configuration](/blog/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Robots_txt) guide\n- {{Glossary(\"robots.txt\")}} glossary entry\n- {{Glossary(\"Search engine\")}} glossary entry\n- {{RFC(\"9309\", \"Robots Exclusion Protocol\")}}\n- [WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions)\n- [Using the robots meta tag](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag#robotsmeta) on developers.google.com\n","slug":"35d60c379f6844479d7599167d157fdb","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T19:05:42.169Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T19:05:42.169Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

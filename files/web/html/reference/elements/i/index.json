Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the `<i>` naming of this element.\n\n{{InteractiveExample(\"HTML Demo: &lt;i&gt;\", \"tabbed-shorter\")}}\n\n```html interactive-example\n<p>I looked at it and thought <i>This can't be real!</i></p>\n\n<p>\n  <i>Musa</i> is one of two or three genera in the family <i>Musaceae</i>; it\n  includes bananas and plantains.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The term <i>bandwidth</i> describes the measure of how much information can\n  pass through a data connection in a given amount of time.\n</p>\n```\n\n```css interactive-example\ni {\n  /* Add your styles here */\n}\n```\n\n## Attributes\n\nThis element only includes the [global attributes](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).\n\n## Usage notes\n\n- Use the `<i>` element for text that is set off from the normal prose for readability reasons. This would be a range of text with different semantic meaning than the surrounding text. Among the use cases for the `<i>` element are spans of text representing a different quality or mode of text, such as:\n\n  - Alternative voice or mood\n  - Taxonomic designations (such as the genus and species \"_Homo sapiens_\")\n  - Idiomatic terms from another language (such as \"_et cetera_\"); these should include the [`lang`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) attribute to identify the language\n  - Technical terms\n  - Transliterations\n  - Thoughts (such as \"She wondered, _What is this writer talking about, anyway?_\")\n  - Ship or vessel names in Western writing systems (such as \"They searched the docks for the _Empress of the Galaxy_, the ship to which they were assigned.\")\n\n- In earlier versions of the HTML specification, the `<i>` element was merely a presentational element used to display text in italics, much like the `<b>` element was used to display text in bold letters. This is no longer true, as these tags now define semantics rather than typographic appearance. A browser will typically still display the contents of the `<i>` element in italic type, but is, by definition, no longer required to do so. To display text in italic type, authors should use the CSS {{cssxref(\"font-style\")}} property.\n- Be sure the text in question is not actually more appropriately marked up with another element.\n\n  - Use {{HTMLElement(\"em\")}} to indicate stress emphasis.\n  - Use {{HTMLElement(\"strong\")}} to indicate importance, seriousness, or urgency.\n  - Use {{HTMLElement(\"mark\")}} to indicate relevance.\n  - Use {{HTMLElement(\"cite\")}} to mark up the name of a work, such as a book, play, or song.\n  - Use {{HTMLElement(\"dfn\")}} to mark up the defining instance of a term.\n\n## Examples\n\nThis example demonstrates using the `<i>` element to mark text that is in another language.\n\n```html\n<p>\n  The Latin phrase <i lang=\"la\">Veni, vidi, vici</i> is often mentioned in\n  music, art, and literature.\n</p>\n```\n\n### Result\n\n{{EmbedLiveSample(\"Examples\")}}\n\n## Technical summary\n\n<table class=\"properties\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">\n        <a href=\"/blog/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories\"\n          >Content categories</a\n        >\n      </th>\n      <td>\n        <a href=\"/blog/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#flow_content\"\n          >Flow content</a\n        >,\n        <a href=\"/blog/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#phrasing_content\"\n          >phrasing content</a\n        >, palpable content.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Permitted content</th>\n      <td>\n        <a href=\"/blog/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#phrasing_content\"\n          >Phrasing content</a\n        >.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Tag omission</th>\n      <td>None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Permitted parents</th>\n      <td>\n        Any element that accepts\n        <a href=\"/blog/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#phrasing_content\"\n          >phrasing content</a\n        >.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Implicit ARIA role</th>\n      <td>\n        <code\n          ><a href=\"/blog/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/generic_role\"\n            >generic</a\n          ></code\n        >\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Permitted ARIA roles</th>\n      <td>Any</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">DOM interface</th>\n      <td>{{domxref(\"HTMLElement\")}}</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Specifications\n\n{{Specifications}}\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n{{Compat}}\n\n## See also\n\n- {{HTMLElement(\"em\")}}\n- Other italicized elements: {{HTMLElement(\"var\")}}, {{HTMLElement(\"dfn\")}}, {{HTMLElement(\"cite\")}}, {{HTMLElement(\"address\")}}\n","slug":"05081d4a5bc64dcb825d731f691d5f69","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T19:06:07.559Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T19:06:07.559Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

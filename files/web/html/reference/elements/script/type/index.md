This is part of the {{domxref(\"Speculation Rules API\", \"\", \"\", \"nocode\")}}.\n- **Any other value**\n  - : The embedded content is treated as a data block, and won't be processed by the browser.\n    Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks.\n    All of the other attributes will be ignored, including the `src` attribute.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In earlier browsers, the type identified the scripting language of the embedded or imported (via the `src` attribute) code.\n\n## Specifications\n\n{{Specifications}}\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n{{Compat}}\n","slug":"f6466c8d8e114577aeaa154e73345129","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T19:06:14.690Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T19:06:14.690Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

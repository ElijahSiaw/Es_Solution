The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Do not use this element.\n>\n> - It has been deprecated since HTML3.2 and was not implemented in a consistent way. It was completely removed from current HTML.\n> - Use the {{HTMLElement(\"pre\")}} element or, if semantically adequate, the {{HTMLElement(\"code\")}} element instead. Note that you will need to escape the `<` character as `&lt;` and the `&` character as `&amp;` to make sure they are not interpreted as markup.\n> - A monospaced font can also be obtained on any element, by applying an adequate [CSS](/blog/Web/CSS) style using `monospace` as the generic-font value for the {{cssxref(\"font-family\")}} property.\n\n## Attributes\n\nThis element has no other attributes than the [global attributes](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes), common to all elements.\n\n## DOM interface\n\nThis element implements the {{domxref('HTMLElement')}} interface.\n\n<!-- ## Technical summary -->\n\n## Specifications\n\n{{Specifications}}\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n{{Compat}}\n\n## See also\n\n- The {{HTMLElement(\"pre\")}} and {{HTMLElement(\"code\")}} elements to be used instead.\n- The {{HTMLElement(\"plaintext\")}} element, similar to `<xmp>` but also obsolete.\n","slug":"5d0ef8f53a08452785928ebd32aa2ac3","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T19:05:59.436Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T19:05:59.436Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"HTML attribute: Autofocus","tag":"web/html/reference/global_attributes/autofocus","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"web/html/reference/global_attributes\")}}\n\nThe **`autofocus`** [global attribute](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) is a Boolean attribute indicating that an element should be focused on page load, or when the {{HTMLElement(\"dialog\")}} that it is part of is displayed.\n\n```html\n<input name=\"q\" autofocus />\n```\n\nNo more than one element in the document or dialog may have the autofocus attribute. If applied to multiple elements the first one will receive focus.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `autofocus` attribute applies to all elements, not just form controls. For example, it might be used on a [contenteditable](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/contenteditable) area.\n\n## Accessibility concerns\n\nAutomatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When `autofocus` is assigned, screen-readers \"teleport\" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand.\n\nUse careful consideration for accessibility when applying the `autofocus` attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content.\n\n## Specifications\n\n{{Specifications}}\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n{{Compat}}\n","slug":"0b29f4c9ae884deb86a3171165089f3d","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-06T10:19:46.610Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-06T10:19:46.610Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

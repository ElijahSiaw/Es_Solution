{"title":"Origin","tag":"glossary/origin","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nWeb content's **origin** is defined by the _scheme_ (protocol), _hostname_ (domain), and _port_ of the {{Glossary(\"URL\")}} used to access it. Two objects have the same origin only when the scheme, hostname, and port all match.\n\nSome operations are restricted to same-origin content, and this restriction can be lifted using {{Glossary(\"CORS\")}}.\n\n## Examples\n\nThese are same origin because they have the same scheme (`http`) and hostname (`example.com`), and the different file path does not matter:\n\n- `http://example.com/app1/index.html`\n- `http://example.com/app2/index.html`\n\nThese are same origin because a server delivers HTTP content through port 80 by default:\n\n- `http://example.com:80`\n- `http://example.com`\n\nThese are not same origin because they use different schemes:\n\n- `http://example.com/app1`\n- `https://example.com/app2`\n\nThese are not same origin because they use different hostnames:\n\n- `http://example.com`\n- `http://www.example.com`\n- `http://myapp.example.com`\n\nThese are not same origin because they use different ports:\n\n- `http://example.com`\n- `http://example.com:8080`\n\n## See also\n\n- [Same-origin policy](/blog/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Site\")}}\n- [HTML specification: origin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#origin)\n","slug":"6d8ac880633940389652f76a2fd8ef87","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:02.654Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:02.654Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

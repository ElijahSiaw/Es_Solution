{"title":"Constructor","tag":"glossary/constructor","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **constructor** is a specialized {{glossary(\"function\")}} that generates {{glossary(\"object\", \"objects\")}} with the same shape and behavior. The constructor initializes this object with some data specific to the object. The concept of a constructor can be applied to most {{glossary(\"OOP\",\"object-oriented programming\")}} languages.\n\nIn {{glossary(\"JavaScript\")}}, a constructor is usually declared within a [class](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), but it can also be declared as a [function](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions). In fact, any function that can be called with the [`new`](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) operator is a constructor.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Classes and constructors in JavaScript](/blog/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Advanced_JavaScript_objects/Classes_in_JavaScript#classes_and_constructors)\n- [`new` operator in JavaScript](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new)\n- [Constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_%28object-oriented_programming%29) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"d0d716bba6454238bc87e293784855d1","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:15.739Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:15.739Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

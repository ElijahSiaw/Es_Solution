This time includes {{Glossary(\"DNS\")}} lookup and establishing the connection using a {{Glossary(\"TCP\")}} handshake and {{Glossary(\"TLS\")}} handshake if the request is made over {{Glossary(\"HTTPS\")}}.\n\nTTFB is the time it takes between the start of the request and the start of the response, in milliseconds. This can be measured using the {{domxref(\"PerformanceResourceTiming.responseStart\", \"responseStart\")}} attribute of {{domxref(\"PerformanceNavigationTiming\")}}:\n\n```js\nconst ttfb = performance.getEntriesByType(\"navigation\")[0].responseStart;\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For sites using {{HTTPStatus(\"103\", \"103 Early Hints\")}}, TTFB is typically the _first bytes_ (after any redirects) â€” and so, the 103 interim response. Site owners wishing to measure the time until the final response should use {{domxref(\"PerformanceResourceTiming.finalResponseHeadersStart\", \"finalResponseHeadersStart\")}}, where supported.\n\n## See also\n\n- [A typical HTTP session](/blog/Web/HTTP/Guides/Session)\n- [PerformanceResourceTiming](/blog/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming)\n- [PerformanceNavigationTiming](/blog/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming)\n","slug":"1ef2c147b6c243fe833717add02697c1","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.261Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.261Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

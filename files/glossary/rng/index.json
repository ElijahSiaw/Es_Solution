{"title":"Rng","tag":"glossary/rng","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **PRNG** (pseudorandom number generator) is an algorithm that outputs numbers in a complex, seemingly unpredictable pattern. Truly random numbers (say, from a radioactive source) are utterly unpredictable, whereas all algorithms are predictable, and a PRNG returns the same numbers when passed the same starting parameters or _seed_.\n\nPRNGs can be used for a variety of applications, such as games.\n\nA cryptographically secure PRNG is a PRNG with certain extra properties making it suitable for use in cryptography. These include:\n\n- that it's computationally unfeasible for an attacker (without knowledge of the seed) to predict its output\n- that if an attacker can work out its current state, this should not enable the attacker to work out previously emitted numbers.\n\nMost PRNGs are not cryptographically secure.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Pseudorandom number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) on Wikipedia\n- {{jsxref(\"Math.random()\")}}, a built-in JavaScript PRNG function. Note that this is not a cryptographically secure PRNG.\n- {{domxref(\"Crypto.getRandomValues()\")}}: this is intended to provide cryptographically secure numbers.\n","slug":"828e139bd47745bcac1c184d64223dfe","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:11.929Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:11.929Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

The performance mantra of RAIL is \"Focus on the user; the end goal isn't to make your site perform fast on any specific device, it's to make users happy.\" There are 4 stages of interaction: page load, idle, response to input, and scrolling and animation. In acronym order, the main tenets are:\n\n- **Response**\n  - : Respond to users immediately, acknowledging any user input in **100ms** or less.\n- **Animation**\n  - : When animating, render each frame in under **16ms**, aiming for consistency and avoiding jank.\n- **Idle**\n  - : When using the main JavaScript thread, work in chunks for less than **50ms** to free up the thread for user interactions.\n- **Load**\n  - : Deliver interactive content in less than **5 second**.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Recommended Web Performance Timings: How long is too long](/blog/Web/Performance/Guides/How_long_is_too_long)\n","slug":"5d8c18188055440c91d6237f32bc998f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:09.135Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:09.135Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

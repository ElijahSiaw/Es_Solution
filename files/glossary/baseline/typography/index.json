Baselines guide the design of glyphs in a font and the alignment of glyphs from different fonts or font sizes when typesetting.\n\nThe **alphabetic baseline** is the value of the CSS `baseline` keyword. The bottom of most alphabetic glyphs typically align with the alphabetic baseline; most characters of European and West Asian fonts rest _on top_ of the alphabetic baseline.\n\nOther writing systems have different baselines. For example, Tibetan and similar unicameral scripts with a strong but not absolute top edge are aligned to the bottom of a \"hanging\" baseline. East Asian scripts have no baseline; each glyph sits in a square box, with neither ascenders nor descenders. When mixed with scripts with a low baseline, East Asian characters should be set so that the bottom of the character is between the baseline and the descender height.\n\n## See also\n\n- [CSS box alignment](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment/Box_alignment#types_of_alignment)\n- [CSS inline layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_inline_layout) module\n- [Baseline (Typography)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography)>) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"eee63651b4e8468691fd65d5c301a19e","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:51.421Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:51.421Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

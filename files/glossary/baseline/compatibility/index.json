Baseline describes web features as being either widely available or newly available. Features that do not meet the Baseline criteria are said to have limited availability.\n\nBaseline considers support in the following browsers:\n\n- Apple Safari (iOS)\n- Apple Safari (macOS)\n- Google Chrome (Android)\n- Google Chrome (desktop)\n- Microsoft Edge (desktop)\n- Mozilla Firefox (Android)\n- Mozilla Firefox (desktop)\n\nBaseline is a summary of browser support. It is not a substitute for accessibility, usability, performance, security, or other testing. Baseline may not tell you if a feature works with:\n\n- Older devices and browser releases\n- Browsers not covered by the Baseline definition, such as operating system web views\n- Assistive technology, such as screen readers.\n\n## Baseline badges\n\n![Green widget with the checkmark: Baseline, widely available.

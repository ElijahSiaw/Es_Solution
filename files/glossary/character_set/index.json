{"title":"Character set","tag":"glossary/character_set","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **character set** is an encoding system to let computers know how to recognize {{Glossary(\"Character\")}}, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and whitespace.\n\nIn earlier times, countries developed their own character sets due to their different languages used, such as Kanji JIS codes (e.g., Shift-JIS, EUC-JP, etc.) for Japanese, Big5 for traditional Chinese, and KOI8-R for Russian. However, {{Glossary(\"Unicode\")}} gradually became most acceptable character set for its universal language support.\n\nIf a character set is used incorrectly (For example, Unicode for an article encoded in Big5), you may see nothing but broken characters, which are called [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) (Wikipedia)\n- [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake) (Wikipedia)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Character\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Unicode\")}}\n","slug":"ca60fe6f9e784770af1b414fe5d82f07","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:04.426Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:04.426Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

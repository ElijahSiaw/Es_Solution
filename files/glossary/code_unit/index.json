{"title":"Code unit","tag":"glossary/code_unit","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **code unit** is the basic component used by a character encoding system (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16). A character encoding system uses one or more code units to encode a Unicode {{Glossary(\"code point\")}}.\n\nIn UTF-16 (the encoding system used for JavaScript strings) code units are 16-bit values. This means that operations such as indexing into a string or getting the length of a string operate on these 16-bit units. These units do not always map 1-1 onto what we might consider characters.\n\nFor example, characters with diacritics such as accents can sometimes be represented using two Unicode code points:\n\n```js\nconst myString = \"\\u006E\\u0303\";\nconsole.log(myString); // Ã±\nconsole.log(myString.length); // 2\n```\n\nAlso, since not all of the code points defined by Unicode fit into 16 bits, many Unicode code points are encoded as a pair of UTF-16 code units, which is called a _surrogate pair_:\n\n```js\nconst face = \"ðŸ¥µ\";\nconsole.log(face.length); // 2\n```\n\nThe {{jsxref(\"String/codePointAt\", \"codePointAt()\")}} method of the JavaScript {{jsxref(\"String\")}} object enables you to retrieve the Unicode code point from its encoded form:\n\n```js\nconst face = \"ðŸ¥µ\";\nconsole.log(face.codePointAt(0)); // 129397\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Unicode encoding FAQ](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html)\n","slug":"7abf0f55bd214aed9fd98efbc508466e","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:10.179Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:10.179Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

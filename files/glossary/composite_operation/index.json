{"title":"Composite operation","tag":"glossary/composite_operation","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn CSS, the value of a property in a CSS rule is the _underlying value_ of that property, and the value of that same property in a [keyframe](/blog/Web/CSS/@keyframes) is its _effect value_.\n\n**Composite operation** is the specific operation that is used to combine an effect value with an underlying value to produce the final keyframe effect value. There are three types of composite operations:\n\n- **replace**: The effect value replaces the underlying value. The final effect value in this case is the original effect value itself.\n- **add**: The effect value is added to the underlying value.\n- **accumulate**: The effect value is combined with the underlying value.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Composite operation in CSS only applies to animations.\n\n## See also\n\n- [`animation-composition`](/blog/Web/CSS/animation-composition)\n- [`KeyframeEffect.composite`](/blog/Web/API/KeyframeEffect/composite)\n","slug":"8933bb75dba546e2b43efd3192ca715b","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:13.109Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:13.110Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

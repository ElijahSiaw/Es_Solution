A sequence of bytes allows for different textual interpretations. By specifying a particular encoding (such as UTF-8), we specify how the sequence of bytes is to be interpreted.\n\nFor example, in HTML we normally declare a character encoding of UTF-8, using the following line:\n\n```html\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n```\n\nThis ensures that you can use characters from just about any human language in your HTML document, and they will display reliably.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Character encoding on W3C](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/definitions-characters/)\n- [Character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"e479c8f40115489293df5f1af093f5c0","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:03.699Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:03.699Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Iife","tag":"glossary/iife","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nAn **IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is an idiom in which a {{glossary(\"JavaScript\")}} {{glossary(\"function\")}} runs as soon as it is defined. It is also known as a _self-executing anonymous function_. The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in [his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033208/http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/#iife).\n\n```js\n// standard IIFE\n(function () {\n  // statements…\n})();\n\n// arrow function variant\n(() => {\n  // statements…\n})();\n\n// async IIFE\n(async () => {\n  // statements…\n})();\n```\n\nIt contains two major parts:\n\n1. A [function _expression_](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function). This usually needs to be [enclosed in parentheses](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Grouping) in order to be parsed correctly.\n2. Immediately _calling_ the function expression. Arguments may be provided, though IIFEs without arguments are more common.\n\nIIFEs are a common pattern used to execute arbitrarily many statements in their own scope (and possibly return a value), in a location that requires a single expression. They are similar to, but much more powerful than, the [comma operator](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_operator), which can only execute multiple expressions and, therefore, does not provide a way to use local variables or control flow statements.\n\nUse cases of IIFEs include:\n\n- Avoiding polluting the global namespace by creating a new {{glossary(\"scope\")}}.\n- Creating a new async context to use {{jsxref(\"Operators/await\", \"await\")}} in a non-async context.\n- Computing values with complex logic, such as using multiple statements as a single expression.\n\nFor code examples, see the [`function` expression](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) and [`async function` expression](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/async_function) reference pages.\n\n## See also\n\n- [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression) (Wikipedia)\n- [Comma operator](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_operator)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Function\")}}\n","slug":"9748db67f95c4685a4a9606164c165a9","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:38.665Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:38.665Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Inheritance","tag":"glossary/inheritance","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nInheritance is a major feature of {{glossary(\"OOP\",\"object-oriented programming\")}}. Data abstraction can be carried up several levels, that is, {{glossary(\"class\",\"classes\")}} can have superclasses and subclasses.\n\nAs an app developer, you can choose which of the superclass's {{glossary(\"attribute\",\"attributes\")}} and {{glossary(\"method\",\"methods\")}} to keep and add your own, making class definition very flexible. Some languages let a class inherit from more than one parent (multiple inheritance).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Inheritance and the prototype chain](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)\n","slug":"377b9ca76e8e4455a17fa483593c0fa9","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:41.323Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:41.323Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

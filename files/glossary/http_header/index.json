For example, a request message can use headers to indicate it's preferred media formats, while a response can use header to indicate the media format of the returned body. Headers are case-insensitive, begin at the start of a line and are immediately followed by a `':'` and a header-dependent value. The value finishes at the next CRLF or at the end of the message.\n\nThe HTTP and Fetch specifications refer to a number of header categories, including:\n\n- {{Glossary(\"Request header\")}}: Headers containing more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself.\n- {{Glossary(\"Response header\")}}: Headers with additional information about the response, like its location or about the server itself (name, version, â€¦).\n- {{Glossary(\"Representation header\")}}: metadata about the resource in the message body (e.g., encoding, media type, etc.).\n- {{Glossary(\"Fetch metadata request header\")}}: Headers with metadata about the resource in the message body (e.g., encoding, media type, etc.).\n\nA basic request with one header:\n\n```http\nGET /example.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n```\n\nRedirects have mandatory headers ({{HTTPHeader(\"Location\")}}):\n\n```http\n302 Found\nLocation: /NewPage.html\n```\n\nA typical set of headers:\n\n```http\n304 Not Modified\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAge: 2318192\nCache-Control: public, max-age=315360000\nConnection: keep-alive\nDate: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 16:06:00 GMT\nServer: Apache\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nVia: 1.1 3dc30c7222755f86e824b93feb8b5b8c.cloudfront.net (CloudFront)\nX-Amz-Cf-Id: TOl0FEm6uI4fgLdrKJx0Vao5hpkKGZULYN2TWD2gAWLtr7vlNjTvZw==\nX-Backend-Server: developer6.webapp.scl3.mozilla.com\nX-Cache: Hit from cloudfront\nX-Cache-Info: cached\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Older versions of the specification referred to:\n>\n> - {{Glossary(\"General header\")}}: Headers applying to both requests and responses but with no relation to the data eventually transmitted in the body.\n> - {{Glossary(\"Entity header\")}}: Headers containing more information about the body of the entity, like its content length or its MIME-type (this is a superset of what are now referred to as the Representation metadata headers)\n\n## See also\n\n- [List of all HTTP headers](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers)\n- Syntax of [headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2) in the HTTP specification\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Request header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Response header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Representation header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Fetch metadata request header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Forbidden request header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Forbidden response header name\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"CORS-safelisted request header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"CORS-safelisted response header\")}}\n","slug":"32de7b5b37e2442f9bb0deba54e52cfd","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:31.460Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:31.460Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Encryption","tag":"glossary/encryption","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn {{glossary(\"cryptography\")}}, **encryption** is the conversion of {{glossary(\"plaintext\")}} into a coded text or {{glossary(\"ciphertext\")}}. A ciphertext is intended to be unreadable by unauthorized readers.\n\nEncryption is a cryptographic primitive: it transforms a plaintext message into a ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm called a {{glossary(\"cipher\")}}. Encryption in modern ciphers is performed using a specific algorithm and a secret, called the {{glossary(\"key\")}}. Since the algorithm is often public, the key must stay secret if the encryption stays secure.\n\n![How encryption works.](encryption.png)\n\nWithout knowing the secret, the reverse operation, {{glossary(\"decryption\")}}, is mathematically hard to perform. How hard depends on the security of the cryptographic algorithm chosen and evolves with the progress of {{glossary(\"cryptanalysis\")}}.\n","slug":"6df4d1bc916c402ea080d62b00842b09","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:47.426Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:47.426Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

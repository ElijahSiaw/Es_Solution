{"title":"Scm","tag":"glossary/scm","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nSCM (Source Control Management) is a system for managing source code. Usually it refers to the use of software to handle versioning of source files. A programmer can modify source code files without being afraid of editing out useful stuff, because a SCM keeps track of how the source code has changed and who made the changes.\n\nSome SCM systems include CVS, SVN, GIT.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Revision control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"73f20c348b0342bd93ce3013939e9135","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:13.131Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:13.132Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Preflight request","tag":"glossary/preflight_request","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA CORS preflight request is a {{Glossary(\"CORS\")}} request that checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood and a server is aware using specific methods and headers.\n\nIt is an {{HTTPMethod(\"OPTIONS\")}} request, using two or three HTTP request headers: {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Request-Method\")}}, {{HTTPHeader(\"Origin\")}}, and optionally {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Request-Headers\")}}.\n\nA preflight request is automatically issued by a browser and in normal cases, front-end developers don't need to craft such requests themselves. It appears when request is qualified as [\"to be preflighted\"](/blog/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#preflighted_requests) and omitted for [simple requests](/blog/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests).\n\nFor example, a client might be asking a server if it would allow a {{HTTPMethod(\"DELETE\")}} request, before sending a `DELETE` request, by using a preflight request:\n\n```http\nOPTIONS /resource/foo\nAccess-Control-Request-Method: DELETE\nAccess-Control-Request-Headers: x-requested-with\nOrigin: https://foo.bar.org\n```\n\nIf the server allows it, then it will respond to the preflight request with an {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\")}} response header, which lists `DELETE`:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.bar.org\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 86400\n```\n\nThe preflight response can be optionally cached for the requests created in the same {{Glossary(\"URL\")}} using {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Max-Age\")}} header like in the above example. To cache preflight responses, the browser uses a specific cache that is separate from the general HTTP cache that the browser manages. Preflight responses are never cached in the browser's general HTTP cache.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"CORS\")}}\n- {{HTTPMethod(\"OPTIONS\")}}\n","slug":"0618261881c84597aa71a67eb28d9b9f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:06.219Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:06.219Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

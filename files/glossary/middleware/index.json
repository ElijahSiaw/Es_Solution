{"title":"Middleware","tag":"glossary/middleware","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nMiddleware is a (loosely defined) term for any software or service that enables the parts of a system to communicate and manage data. It is the software that handles communication between components and input/output, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of their application.\n\nIn server-side web application frameworks, the term is often more specifically used to refer to pre-built software components that can be added to the framework's request/response processing pipeline, to handle tasks such as database access.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Middleware\\_(distributed_applications)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware_(distributed_applications)>) on Wikipedia\n- [Middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"45ec89dfe4b54743976972c70f5199a5","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:59.312Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:59.312Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

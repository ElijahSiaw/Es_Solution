{"title":"Bun","tag":"glossary/bun","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Bun** is a fast and modern {{Glossary(\"JavaScript\")}} runtime environment designed to prioritize performance and developer tooling.\n\nUnlike [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Deno](https://deno.com/), Bun is built on Apple's [JavaScriptCore](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore). Notable features of Bun include:\n\n- Drop-in Node.js replacement: almost all Node.js programs can run using Bun-equivalent commands.\n- State-of-the-art JavaScript execution speed in most real-world scenarios.\n- Native support for JavaScript syntax extensions like JSX and TypeScript.\n- Global cache for managing package installations to minimize disk usage.\n- Built-in bundler, transpiler, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) compatible test-runner, package manager, and more built-in utilities that web developers may find useful.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Bun website](https://bun.sh/)\n","slug":"f879f614572d4d11ada190c23abddc6f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:58.028Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:58.028Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

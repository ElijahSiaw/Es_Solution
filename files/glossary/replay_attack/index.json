{"title":"Replay attack","tag":"glossary/replay_attack","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn web security, a _replay attack_ happens when an attacker intercepts a previously-sent message and resends it later to get the same credentials as the original message, potentially with a different payload or instruction.\n\nReplay attacks can be prevented by including a unique, single-use identifier with each message that the receiver can use to verify the authenticity of the transmission. This identifier can take the form of a session token or \"number used only once\" (\"nonce\").\n\n## See also\n\n- [Replay attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack) on Wikipedia.\n","slug":"30c432ac1393490c82130eea6e586fff","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:11.021Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:11.021Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

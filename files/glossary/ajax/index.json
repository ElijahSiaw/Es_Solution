{"title":"Ajax","tag":"glossary/ajax","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nAsynchronous JavaScript and XML (**Ajax**, or **AJAX**) is a web development technique in which a web app fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests, and uses the new content to update the relevant parts of the page without requiring a full page load. This can make the page more responsive, because only the parts that need to be updated are requested.\n\nAjax can be used to create {{Glossary(\"SPA\", \"single-page apps\")}}, in which the entire web app consists of a single document, which uses Ajax to update its content as needed.\n\nInitially Ajax was implemented using the {{domxref(\"XMLHttpRequest\")}} interface, but the {{domxref(\"Window/fetch\", \"fetch()\")}} API is more suitable for modern web applications: it is more powerful, more flexible, and integrates better with fundamental web app technologies such as [service workers](/blog/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). Modern web frameworks also provide abstractions for Ajax.\n\nThis technique is so common in modern web development that the specific term \"Ajax\" is rarely used.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Learn: Making network requests with JavaScript](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests)\n- [Fetch API](/blog/Web/API/Fetch_API)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"SPA\", \"Single-page application\")}}\n- {{DOMxRef(\"XMLHttpRequest\")}}\n- [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"c1390a4823c5476694ac6c59a3289518","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.863Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.863Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

Minification is used to improve web performance by reducing file size. It is generally an automated step that occurs at build time.\n\nAs minification makes code less legible to humans, developer tools have 'prettification' features that can add white space back into the code to make it a bit more legible.\n","slug":"ebe3fe67fb234adbaf80f292330db537","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:59.554Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:59.554Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

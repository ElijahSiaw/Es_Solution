{"title":"Layout mode","tag":"glossary/layout_mode","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **layout mode**, sometimes called _layout_, is a [CSS](/blog/Web/CSS) algorithm that determines the position and size of element boxes based on the way they interact with their sibling and ancestor boxes.\n\nThere are several layout modes:\n\n- **[Flow layout or normal flow](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Flow_layout)**\n\n  - : All elements are part of normal flow until you do something to take them out of it.Normal flow includes:\n\n    - **[Block layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_and_inline_layout_in_normal_flow)**\n      - : Designed for laying out boxes such as paragraphs.\n    - **[Inline layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_inline_layout)**\n      - : Designed for laying out inline items such as text.\n\n- **[Table layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_table)**\n  - : Designed for laying out tables.\n- **Float layout**\n  - : Designed to cause an item to position itself left or right with the rest of the content in normal flow wrapping around it.\n- **[Positioned layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout)**\n  - : Designed for positioning elements without much interaction with other elements.\n- **[Multi-column layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout)**\n  - : Designed for laying content out in columns as in a newspaper.\n- **[Flexible box layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout)**\n  - : Designed for laying out complex pages that can be resized smoothly.\n- **[Grid layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout)**\n  - : Designed for laying out elements relative to a fixed grid.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Not all [CSS properties](/blog/Web/CSS/Reference) apply to all _layout modes_. Most of them apply to one or two of them and have no effect if they are set on an element participating in another layout mode.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Visual formatting model](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Visual_formatting_model)\n- [CSS display](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_display) module\n","slug":"9effe324a71343d198ab4ba61fd2e638","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.226Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.226Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Constant","tag":"glossary/constant","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **constant** is a value that the programmer cannot change, for example numbers (1, 2, 42). With {{glossary(\"variable\",\"variables\")}}, on the other hand, the programmer can assign a new {{glossary(\"value\")}} to a variable name already in use.\n\nLike variables, some constants are bound to identifiers. For example, the identifier `pi` could be bound to the value 3.14â€¦.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Constant](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(computer_programming)>) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"91a15155e207481f8af800a198099356","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:15.180Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:15.181Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

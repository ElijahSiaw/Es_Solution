{"title":"Continuous media","tag":"glossary/continuous_media","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Continuous media** is data where there is a timing relationship between source and destination. The most common examples of continuous media are audio and motion video. Continuous media can be real-time (interactive), where there is a \"tight\" timing relationship between source and sink, or streaming (playback), where the relationship is less strict.\n\nCSS can be used in a variety of contexts, including print media. And some CSS, particularly those that are used for layout, behave differently depending on the context they are in.\n\nContinuous Media, therefore, identifies a context where the content is not broken up. It flows continuously. Web content displayed on a screen is continuous media, as is spoken content.\n","slug":"bc7177786d654607b7a7d21cbd322652","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:16.754Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:16.754Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

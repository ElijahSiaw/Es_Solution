The code can then do anything that the site's own code can do. For example, the attacker could:\n\n- Access and modify all the content of the site's loaded pages, and any content in local storage\n- Make HTTP requests with the user's credentials, enabling them to impersonate the user or access sensitive data\n\nAll XSS attacks depend on a website doing two things:\n\n1. Accepting some input that could have been crafted by an attacker\n2. Including this input in a page without sanitizing it: that is, without ensuring that it won't be executable as JavaScript\n\n## See also\n\n- [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](/blog/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS)\n- [Cross-site scripting on OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)\n","slug":"d1864cd5933449d79a86c72efe77c13d","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:21.991Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:21.991Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

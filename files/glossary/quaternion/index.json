{"title":"Quaternion","tag":"glossary/quaternion","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **quaternion** is the quotient of two 3D vectors and is used in 3D graphics and in accelerometer-based sensors to represent orientation or rotational data.\n\nWhile mathematical quaternions are more involved than this, the **unit quaternions** (or **rotational quaternions**) used to represent rotation while using {{Glossary(\"WebGL\")}} or [WebXR](/blog/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API), for example, are represented using the same syntax as a 3D point. As such, the type {{domxref(\"DOMPoint\")}} (or {{domxref(\"DOMPointReadOnly\")}}) is used to store quaternions.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Quaternions and spatial rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation) on Wikipedia\n- [Quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) on Wikipedia\n- {{domxref(\"XRRigidTransform.orientation\")}} in the WebXR Device API reference\n","slug":"3bfe32f017cf42548daf4b1d7f873bc5","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:08.886Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:08.886Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

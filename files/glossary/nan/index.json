{"title":"Nan","tag":"glossary/nan","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nNaN (Not a Number) is a numeric {{Glossary(\"Type\", \"data type\")}} that means an undefined value or value that cannot be represented, especially results of floating-point calculations.\n\nFor example, NaNs can represent infinity, result of division by zero, missing value, or the square root of a negative (which is imaginary, whereas a floating-point number is real).\n\nPractically speaking, if I divide two variables in a {{glossary(\"JavaScript\")}} program, the result may be NaN, which is predefined in JavaScript as \"undefined\". Hence this division may break the program. Now, if this computation was a small part of a much larger algorithm, it would be really painful to figure out where the error actually occurs. Fortunately, since the result will be NaN and I know my divisor may turn out to be 0, I can set up testing conditions that prevent any such computations in the first place or notify me of where they happen.\n\n## See also\n\n- [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN) on Wikipedia\n- [NaN in JavaScript](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN)\n","slug":"2003f1ce385c4232863896f124421b37","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:00.276Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:00.277Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

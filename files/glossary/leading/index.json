{"title":"Leading","tag":"glossary/leading","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn typography, **leading** is an amount of space included above and below text to provide spacing between lines. Historically, in physical typesetting, pieces of actual [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) were used to implement this spacing, which is where the name comes from.\n\nIn CSS, typographic leading is the difference between the content height and the line-height, generally set by the {{cssxref(\"line-height\")}} property. Leading set via `line-height` provides spacing between lines, which can be negative. The space is distributed equally above and below the text, which is referred to as **half-leading**.\n\nThe area of a font above the cap baseline is referred to as the _over edge_. The area below the {{glossary(\"/Baseline/Typography\", \"alphabetic baseline\")}} is referred to as the _under edge_. Likewise, the half-leading above and below a line is referred to as the _over leading_ and _under leading_, respectively.\n\nThe half-leading can be trimmed from the block-start edge and block-end edge of a text element's block container using the {{cssxref(\"text-box\")}} properties.\n\n## See also\n\n- {{cssxref(\"line-height\")}}\n- {{cssxref(\"text-box\")}}\n- [CSS inline layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_inline_layout) module\n- [Leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading) on Wikipedia\n- [The Thing With LeadÂ­ing in CSS](https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-thing-with-leading-in-css) on matthiasott.com (2022)\n","slug":"25f2451918f44a03bd8208d75d44fac6","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.409Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.409Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Mobile first","tag":"glossary/mobile_first","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Mobile first**, a form of {{Glossary(\"progressive enhancement\")}}, is a web-development and web-design approach that focuses on prioritizing design and development for mobile screen sizes over design and development for desktop screen sizes. The rationale behind the mobile-first approach is to provide users with good user experiences at all screen sizesâ€”by starting with creating a user experience that works well on small screens, and then building on top of that to further enrich the user experience as the screen size increases. The mobile-first approach contrasts with the older approach of designing for desktop screen sizes first, and then only later adding some support for small screen sizes.\n","slug":"424f228ee26f4219a615e91f8dd397a0","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:59.782Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:59.782Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

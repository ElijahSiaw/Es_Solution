{"title":"Dns","tag":"glossary/dns","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**DNS** (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of {{Glossary(\"domain name\",\"domain names\")}} along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.\n\nThe most prominent function of DNS is the translation of human-friendly domain names (such as mozilla.org) to a numeric {{Glossary(\"IP address\")}} (such as 192.0.2.172); this process of mapping a domain name to the appropriate IP address is known as a **DNS lookup**. By contrast, a **reverse DNS lookup** (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an IP address.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Understanding domain names](/blog/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_domain_name)\n- [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"14a3d6114bd4436a99476a3f17b43c51","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:37.039Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:37.039Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Gamut","tag":"glossary/gamut","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA color **gamut** is a subset of colors, usually representing the colors that a display or a printing device can represent.\n\nNo display or printer can represent the whole range of colors that a human eye can perceive. The device _gamut_ represents the set that it supports.\n\nTraditionally, in web development, the only gamut used was _[sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB)_ (Standard Red-Green-Blue), where each color is described using three bytes, one for each primary color. However, \"wide-color\" monitors and professional printers support a wider range of colors, that can't be represented using this gamut.\n\nSince 2021, browsers have started to provide functionality for other gamuts, like _[Display-P3](/blog/Glossary/Color_space#display-p3)_, widely used in the movie industry, and _[rec2020](/blog/Glossary/Color_space#rec2020)_.\n\nDevelopers can define different sets of colors for devices supporting larger gamuts using the [`color-gamut`](/blog/Web/CSS/@media/color-gamut) [media feature](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries). They can describe colors outside the RGB gamut using specific CSS functions like [`lch()`](/blog/Web/CSS/color_value/lch) for the LCH cylindrical coordinate system, or [`lab()`](/blog/Web/CSS/color_value/lab) for the Lab coordinate system.\n\n## See also\n\n- [_Gamut_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut) on _Wikipedia_.\n","slug":"4db330660c754674ba321a2465d18748","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:09.215Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:09.215Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

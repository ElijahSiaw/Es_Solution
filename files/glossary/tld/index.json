{"title":"Tld","tag":"glossary/tld","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA TLD (_top-level domain_) is the most generic {{Glossary(\"domain\")}} in the Internet's hierarchical {{Glossary(\"DNS\")}} (domain name system). A TLD is the final component of a {{Glossary(\"domain name\")}}, for example, \"org\" in `developer.mozilla.org`.\n\n{{Glossary(\"ICANN\")}} (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) designates organizations to manage each TLD. Depending on how strict an administrating organization might be, TLD often serves as a clue to the purpose, ownership, or nationality of a website.\n\nConsider an example Internet address: `https://developer.mozilla.org`\nHere org is the TLD; mozilla.org is the second-level domain name; and developer is a subdomain name. All together, these constitute a fully-qualified domain name; the addition of https\\:// makes this a complete URL.\n\n{{Glossary(\"IANA\")}} today distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:\n\n- country-code top-level domains (ccTLD)\n  - : Two-character domains established for countries or territories. Example: _.us_ for United States.\n- internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)\n  - : ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic or Chinese).\n- generic top-level domains (gTLD)\n  - : Top-level domains with three or more characters.\n- unsponsored top-level domains\n  - : Domains that operate directly under policies established by ICANN processes for the global Internet community, for example \"com\" and \"edu\".\n- sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)\n  - : These domains are proposed and sponsored by private organizations that decide whether an applicant is eligible to use the TLD, based on community theme concepts.\n- infrastructure top-level domain\n  - : This group consists of one domain, the {{Glossary(\"ARPA\", \"Address and Routing Parameter Area\")}} (ARPA).\n\n## See also\n\n- [TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLD) on Wikipedia\n- [List of top-level domains](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db)\n","slug":"4f4eb4adc2244bcc806666ca11d3bc83","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.384Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.384Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

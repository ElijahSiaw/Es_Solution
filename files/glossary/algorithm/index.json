Computer scientists compare the efficiency of algorithms through the concept of \"Algorithmic Complexity\" or \"Big O\" notation.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A cooking recipe is an algorithm for humans.\n- A sorting algorithm is often used in computer programming to explain to a machine how to sort data.\n\nCommon algorithms are Pathfinding algorithms such as the optimization [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Traveling_salesman_problem), [Tree Traversal algorithms](https://brilliant.org/wiki/traversals/), and so on.\n\nThere are also [Machine Learning algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/articles/machine-learning-algorithms) such as [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Convolutional Neural Network, and so on.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) on Wikipedia\n- [Explanations of sorting algorithms](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)\n- [Explanations of algorithmic complexity](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)\n","slug":"e55e76c4540f4e028d6692bf548a9359","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.927Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.927Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Ice","tag":"glossary/ice","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**ICE** (_Interactive Connectivity Establishment_) is a framework used by {{glossary(\"WebRTC\")}} (among other technologies) for connecting two peers, regardless of network topology (usually for audio and video chat). This protocol lets two peers find and establish a connection with one another even though they may both be using Network Address Translator ({{glossary(\"NAT\")}}) to share a global IP address with other devices on their respective local networks.\n\nThe framework algorithm looks for the lowest-latency path for connecting the two peers, trying these options in order:\n\n1. Direct UDP connection (In this case—and only this case—a {{glossary(\"STUN\")}} server is used to find the network-facing address of a peer)\n2. Direct TCP connection, via the HTTP port\n3. Direct TCP connection, via the HTTPS port\n4. Indirect connection via a relay/{{glossary(\"TURN\")}} server (if a direct connection fails, e.g., if one peer is behind a firewall that blocks NAT traversal)\n\n## See also\n\n- [WebRTC](/blog/Web/API/WebRTC_API), the principal web-related protocol which uses ICE\n- [WebRTC protocols](/blog/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Protocols)\n- {{rfc(\"8445\")}}, the IETF specification for ICE\n- {{domxref(\"RTCIceCandidate\")}}, the interface representing an ICE candidate\n","slug":"897f5d014ba544d399f3e079e5c14f63","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:35.050Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:35.050Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Boolean","tag":"glossary/boolean","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn computer science, a **Boolean** is a logical data type that can have only the values `true` or `false`.\n\nFor example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in [if statements](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)) or repeat (such as in [for loops](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)).\n\nBelow is some JavaScript pseudocode (it's not truly executable code) demonstrating this concept.\n\n```js-nolint\n/* JavaScript if statement */\nif (boolean conditional) {\n  // code to execute if the conditional is true\n}\n\nif (boolean conditional) {\n  console.log(\"boolean conditional resolved to true\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"boolean conditional resolved to false\");\n}\n\n/* JavaScript for loop */\nfor (control variable; boolean conditional; counter) {\n  // code to execute repeatedly if the conditional is true\n}\n```\n\nThe Boolean value is named after English mathematician [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), who pioneered the field of mathematical logic.\n\nAbove is a general introduction. The term **Boolean** can have more specific meanings depending on the context.

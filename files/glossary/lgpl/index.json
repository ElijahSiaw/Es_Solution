{"title":"Lgpl","tag":"glossary/lgpl","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nLGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License) is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation. The LGPL provides a more permissive alternative for the strictly {{Glossary(\"copyleft\")}} {{Glossary(\"GPL\")}}. While any derivative work using a GPL-licensed program must be released under the same terms (free to use, share, study, and modify), the LGPL only requires the LGPL-licensed component of the derivative program to continue using the LGPL, not the whole program. LGPL is usually used to license shared components such as libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.jar`, etc.).\n\n## See also\n\n- [GNU LGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) on Wikipedia\n- [LGPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) text on gnu.org\n","slug":"f955fb00fe0c4e1991acf9ddd02ec2f9","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.464Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.464Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

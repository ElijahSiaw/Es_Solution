{"title":"Breadcrumb","tag":"glossary/breadcrumb","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **breadcrumb**, or breadcrumb trail, is a navigational aid that is typically placed between a site's header and the main content, displaying either a hierarchy of the current page in relation to the site's structure, from top level to current page, or a list of the links the user followed to get to the current page, in the order visited.\n\nA location breadcrumb for this document might look something like this:\n\n[Es Solution](/) > [Glossary](/blog/Glossary) > Breadcrumb\n\nBreadcrumb trails enable users to be aware of their location within a website. This type of navigation, if done correctly, helps users know where they are in a site and how they got there. They can also help a user get back to where they were before and can reduce the number of clicks needed to get to a higher-level page.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> While there's no dedicated [semantic HTML element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#rel-up) for breadcrumb navigation menus, the {{htmlelement(\"ol\")}} element is commonly used to represent their hierarchical structure.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Breadcrumb Navigation](/blog/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Breadcrumb_Navigation)\n- [Google Search Central: Breadcrumb Structured Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/breadcrumb)\n- [APG Guide: Breadcrumb Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/examples/breadcrumb/)\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.8 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/location)\n- [Understanding Technique 65 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G65)\n","slug":"0abd440629934b9da528c1424433a59c","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:56.640Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:56.640Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

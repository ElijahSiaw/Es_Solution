{"title":"Site","tag":"glossary/site","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nInformally, a _site_ is a website, which is a collection of web pages, served from the same domain, and maintained by a single organization.\n\nBrowsers sometimes need to distinguish precisely between different sites. For example, the browser must only send [`SameSite`](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) cookies to the same site that set them.\n\nFor this more precise definition a site is determined by the _registrable domain_ portion of the domain name. The registrable domain consists of an entry in the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) plus the portion of the domain name just before it. This means that, for example, `theguardian.co.uk`, `sussex.ac.uk`, and `bookshop.org` are all registrable domains.\n\nAccording to this definition, `support.mozilla.org` and `developer.mozilla.org` are part of the same site, because `mozilla.org` is a registrable domain.\n\nIn some contexts, the scheme is also considered when differentiating sites. This would make `http://vpl.ca` and `https://vpl.ca` different sites. Including the scheme prevents an insecure (HTTP) site from being treated as the same site as a secure (HTTPS) site. A definition that considers the scheme is sometimes called a _schemeful same-site_. This stricter definition is applied in the rules for handling [`SameSite`](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) cookies.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Browsers sometimes make security decisions (for example, deciding which resources a script can access) based on the {{Glossary(\"Origin\")}} of a resource. This is a more restrictive concept than the site, encompassing the scheme, the whole domain, and the port. See also [same-origin policy](/blog/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).\n\n## Examples\n\nThese are the same site because the registrable domain of `mozilla.org` is the same:\n\n- `https://developer.mozilla.org/blog/`\n- `https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/`\n\nThese are the same site because the port is not relevant:\n\n- `https://example.com:8080`\n- `https://example.com`\n\nThese are not the same site because the registrable domain of the two URLs differs:\n\n- `https://developer.mozilla.org/blog/`\n- `https://example.com`\n\nThese are the same site, or different sites if the scheme is considered:\n\n- `http://example.com`\n- `https://example.com`\n\n## See also\n\n- [What is a URL](/blog/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Origin\")}}\n- [Same-origin policy](/blog/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)\n","slug":"562f1aea90b1476b82581aad882709f4","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.795Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.795Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Hotlink","tag":"glossary/hotlink","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **hotlink** (also known as an **inline link**) is an object (typically an image) directly linked to from another site. For example, an image hosted on site1.com is shown directly on site2.com.\n\nThe practice is frowned upon, as it can cause unwanted bandwidth usage on the website hosting the linked-to object. From an ethical standpoint, it could be considered stealing when done without permission.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Hotlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Hyperlink\")}}\n","slug":"9d4d6657bba94483a02ad52c6b89c3d9","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:25.804Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:25.804Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

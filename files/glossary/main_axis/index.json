{"title":"Main axis","tag":"glossary/main_axis","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nThe main axis in {{glossary(\"flexbox\")}} is defined by the direction set by the {{cssxref(\"flex-direction\")}} property. There are four possible values for `flex-direction`. These are:\n\n- `row`\n- `row-reverse`\n- `column`\n- `column-reverse`\n\nShould you choose `row` or `row-reverse` then your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.\n\n![In this image the flex-direction is row which forms the main axis](basics1.png)\n\nChoose `column` or `column-reverse` and your main axis will run top to bottom of the page in the block direction.\n\n![Three flex items taking up the full width of the container, displayed one below the other in code order. Flex-direction is set to column. The main axis is vertical i.e., from top to bottom](basics2.png)\n\nOn the main axis you can control the sizing of flex items by adding any available space to the items themselves, by way of `flex` properties on the items. Or, you can control the space between and around items by using the `justify-content` property.\n\n## See also\n\n### Property reference\n\n- {{cssxref(\"flex-basis\")}}\n- {{cssxref(\"flex-direction\")}}\n- {{cssxref(\"flex-grow\")}}\n- {{cssxref(\"flex-shrink\")}}\n- {{cssxref(\"justify-content\")}}\n- {{cssxref(\"flex\")}}\n\n### Further reading\n\n- CSS flexbox guides:\n  - [Basic concepts of flexbox](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox)\n  - [Aligning items in a flex container](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items_in_a_flex_container)\n  - [Controlling Ratios of flex items along the main axis](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Controlling_ratios_of_flex_items_along_the_main_axis)\n","slug":"f440a84a7b6e4c208eeda4195051771c","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.341Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.341Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

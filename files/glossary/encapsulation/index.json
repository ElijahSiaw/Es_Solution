{"title":"Encapsulation","tag":"glossary/encapsulation","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nEncapsulation is the packing of data and {{glossary(\"function\",\"functions\")}} into one component (for example, a {{glossary(\"class\")}}) and then controlling access to that component to make a \"blackbox\" out of the {{glossary(\"object\")}}. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Encapsulation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(object-oriented_programming)>) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"0c9f2aa644474918a9bb498651131cc8","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:46.913Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:46.913Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

Idempotency only applies to effects intended by the client: for example, a POST request intends to send data to the server, or a DELETE request intends to delete a resource on the server.\n\nAll {{glossary(\"Safe/HTTP\", \"safe\")}} methods are idempotent, as well as {{HTTPMethod(\"PUT\")}} and {{HTTPMethod(\"DELETE\")}}. The {{HTTPMethod(\"POST\")}} method is not idempotent.\n\nTo be idempotent, only the state of the server is considered. The response returned by each request may differ: for example, the first call of a {{HTTPMethod(\"DELETE\")}} will likely return a {{HTTPStatus(\"200\")}}, while successive ones will likely return a {{HTTPStatus(\"404\")}}. Another implication of {{HTTPMethod(\"DELETE\")}} being idempotent is that developers should not implement RESTful APIs with a _delete last entry_ functionality using the `DELETE` method.\n\nNote that the idempotence of a method is not guaranteed by the server and some applications may incorrectly break the idempotence constraint.\n\n`GET /pageX HTTP/1.1` is idempotent, because it is a safe (read-only) method. Successive calls may return different data to the client, if the data on the server was updated in the meantime.\n\n`POST /add_row HTTP/1.1` is not idempotent; if it is called several times, it adds several rows:\n\n```http\nPOST /add_row HTTP/1.1\nPOST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -> Adds a 2nd row\nPOST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -> Adds a 3rd row\n```\n\n`DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1` is idempotent, even if the returned status code may change between requests:\n\n```http\nDELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 200 if idX exists\nDELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 404 as it just got deleted\nDELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 404\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- Definition of [idempotent](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#idempotent.methods) in the HTTP specification.\n- Description of common idempotent methods: {{HTTPMethod(\"GET\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"HEAD\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"PUT\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"DELETE\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"OPTIONS\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"TRACE\")}}\n- Description of common non-idempotent methods: {{HTTPMethod(\"POST\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"PATCH\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"CONNECT\")}}\n","slug":"9ac971a6ee5b4a15810b498ec6c7f4ca","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:36.079Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:36.079Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

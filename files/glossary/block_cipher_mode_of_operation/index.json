{"title":"Block cipher mode of operation","tag":"glossary/block_cipher_mode_of_operation","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **block cipher mode of operation**, usually just called a \"mode\" in context, specifies how a block cipher should be used to encrypt or decrypt messages that are longer than the block size.\n\nMost symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block ciphers: this means that they encrypt data a block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example AES uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a _mode_, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.\n","slug":"d1ae96052a324951ba2bd5712f7b95d7","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:54.747Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:54.748Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Symmetric-key cryptography","tag":"glossary/symmetric-key_cryptography","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nSymmetric-key cryptography is a term used for cryptographic algorithms that use the same key for encryption and for decryption. The key is usually called a \"symmetric key\" or a \"secret key\".\n\nThis is usually contrasted with {{Glossary(\"public-key cryptography\")}}, in which keys are generated in pairs and the transformation made by one key can only be reversed using the other key.\n\nSymmetric-key algorithms should be secure when used properly and are highly efficient, so they can be used to encrypt large amounts of data without having a negative effect on performance.\n\nMost symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block {{Glossary(\"Cipher\", \"ciphers\")}}: this means that they encrypt data one block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example AES uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a _{{Glossary(\"Block cipher mode of operation\", \"mode\")}}_, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Web Crypto API](/blog/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)\n- [SubtleCrypto supported algorithms](/blog/Web/API/SubtleCrypto#supported_algorithms)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Block cipher mode of operation\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Cryptography\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Hash function\")}}\n","slug":"11e9cf7071db4b8dbc6b274d45d51eab","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:19.424Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:19.424Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

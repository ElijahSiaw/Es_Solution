{"title":"Localization","tag":"glossary/localization","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Localization** (l10n) is the process of adapting a software user interface to a specific culture.\n\nThe following are common factors to consider:\n\n- language\n- unit of measure (e.g., kilometers in Europe, miles in U.S.)\n- text direction (e.g., European languages are left-to-right, Arabic right-to-left)\n- capitalization in Latin script (e.g., English uses capitals for weekdays, Spanish uses lowercase)\n- adaptation of idioms (e.g., \"raining cats and dogs\" makes no sense when translated literally)\n- use of register (e.g., in Japanese respectful speech differs exceptionally from casual speech)\n- number format (e.g., 10 000,00 in Germany vs. 10,000.00 in the U.S.)\n- date format\n- currency\n- cultural references\n- paper size\n- color psychology\n- compliance with local laws\n- local holidays\n- personal names\n\nThe complementary practice, of designing a system so it is easy to localize, is called {{glossary(\"Internationalization\")}}.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Internationalization\")}}\n","slug":"ce5ac4254b8d4ef8a58f413cb2a4ee17","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.807Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:57.807Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

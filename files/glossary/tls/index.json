{"title":"Tls","tag":"glossary/tls","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, formerly known as {{Glossary(\"SSL\", \"Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\")}}, is a {{Glossary(\"protocol\")}} used by applications to communicate securely across a network, preventing tampering with and eavesdropping on email, web browsing, messaging, and other protocols. Both TLS and SSL are client / server protocols that ensure communication privacy by using cryptographic protocols to provide security over a network. When a server and client communicate using TLS, it ensures that no third party can eavesdrop or tamper with any message.\n\nAll modern browsers support the TLS protocol, requiring the server to provide a valid {{Glossary(\"Digital certificate\", \"digital certificate\")}} confirming its identity in order to establish a secure connection. It is possible for both the client and server to mutually authenticate each other, if both parties provide their own individual digital certificates.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All major browsers began removing support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in early 2020; you'll need to make sure your web server supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3 going forward. From version 74 onwards, Firefox will return a [Secure Connection Failed](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-connection-failed-firefox-did-not-connect) error when connecting to servers using the older TLS versions ([Firefox bug 1606734](https://bugzil.la/1606734)).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (Wikipedia)\n- [RFC 8446](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446) (The Transport Layer Security Protocol, Version 1.3)\n- [RFC 5246](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246) (The Transport Layer Security Protocol, Version 1.2)\n- [Transport Layer Security](/blog/Web/Security/Transport_Layer_Security)\n- [Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) (OWASP)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"HTTPS\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"SSL\")}}\n","slug":"b48d8c176f534d83b5a1d4b5c4832ec8","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.462Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.462Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

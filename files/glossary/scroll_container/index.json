A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS {{cssxref(\"overflow\")}} property is set to `scroll` or when `overflow` is set to `auto` _and_ the content overflows the container.\n\nWhen the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view.\n\nA scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars.\n\n## Scrollport\n\nThe scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Learn: Overflowing content](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Overflow)\n- [Scroll snapping](/blog/Glossary/Scroll_snap), including [scroll snap container](/blog/Glossary/Scroll_snap#scroll_snap_container)\n- [CSS overflow](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_overflow) module\n- [CSS overscroll behavior](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_overscroll_behavior) module\n- [CSS scroll snap](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap) module\n","slug":"0da2318225b743c38ad031de9a0ffa50","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:13.837Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:13.837Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

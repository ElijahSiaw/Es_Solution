{"title":"Cors","tag":"glossary/cors","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting {{Glossary(\"HTTP_header\", \"HTTP headers\")}}, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.\n\nThe [same-origin security policy](/blog/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) forbids cross-origin access to resources. But CORS gives web servers the ability to say they want to opt into allowing cross-origin access to their resources.\n\n## CORS headers\n\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\")}}\n  - : Indicates whether the response can be shared.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\")}}\n  - : Indicates whether or not the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\")}}\n  - : Used in response to a preflight request to indicate which HTTP headers can be used when making the actual request.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\")}}\n  - : Specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing the resource in response to a preflight request.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Expose-Headers\")}}\n  - : Indicates which headers can be exposed as part of the response by listing their names.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Max-Age\")}}\n  - : Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Request-Headers\")}}\n  - : Used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which HTTP headers will be used when the actual request is made.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Access-Control-Request-Method\")}}\n  - : Used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which [HTTP method](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods) will be used when the actual request is made.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Origin\")}}\n  - : Indicates where a fetch originates from.\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Timing-Allow-Origin\")}}\n  - : Specifies origins that are allowed to see values of attributes retrieved via features of the [Resource Timing API](/blog/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing), which would otherwise be reported as zero due to cross-origin restrictions.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/blog/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS)\n- [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) on Wikipedia\n- [Fetch specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/)\n","slug":"40af0bd7f7954e5e8c42e827b80ad389","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:18.808Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:18.808Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

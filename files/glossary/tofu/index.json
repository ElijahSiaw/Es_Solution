To do that, clients will look for identifiers (for example public keys) stored locally. If an identifier is found, the client can establish the connection. If no identifier is found, the client can prompt the user to determine if the client should trust the identifier.\n\nTOFU is used in the SSH protocol, in {{HTTPHeader(\"Strict-Transport-Security\")}} ({{Glossary(\"HSTS\")}}) where a browser will obey the redirection rule.\n\n## See also\n\n- Wikipedia: [TOFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use)\n","slug":"9fe8f97f59414a23bb2203652d60346c","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.609Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.609Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

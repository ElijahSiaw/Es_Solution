{"title":"User agent","tag":"glossary/user_agent","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a {{Glossary(\"Browser\",\"browser\")}} in a {{Glossary(\"World Wide Web\", \"Web\")}} context.\n\nBesides a browser, a user agent could be a bot scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the Web. Along with each request they make to the server, browsers include a self-identifying {{HTTPHeader(\"User-Agent\")}} {{Glossary(\"HTTP\")}} header called a user agent (UA) string. This string often identifies the browser, its version number, and its host operating system.\n\nSpam bots, download managers, and some browsers often send a fake UA string to announce themselves as a different client. This is known as _user agent spoofing_.\n\nThe user agent string can be accessed with {{Glossary(\"JavaScript\")}} on the client side using the {{domxref(\"navigator.userAgent\")}} property.\n\nA typical user agent string looks like this: `\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:124.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0\"`.\n\n## See also\n\n- [User agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) on Wikipedia\n- {{domxref(\"navigator.userAgent\")}}\n- [Browser detection using the user agent](/blog/Web/HTTP/Guides/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent)\n- {{RFC(2616, \"\", \"14.43\")}}: The `User-Agent` header\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Browser\")}}\n- HTTP Headers\n\n  - {{HTTPHeader(\"User-agent\")}}\n","slug":"3b10dc77ec7549899434ca0824672be3","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:23.626Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:23.626Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Csrf","tag":"glossary/csrf","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn a **cross-site request forgery** (CSRF) attack, an attacker tricks the browser into making an HTTP request to the target site from a malicious site. The request includes the user's credentials and causes the server to carry out some harmful action, thinking that the user intended it.\n\nA CSRF attack is possible if a website:\n\n- Uses HTTP requests to change some state on the server\n- Uses only cookies to validate that the request came from an authenticated user\n- Uses only parameters in the request that an attacker can predict\n\nThere are several defenses against CSRF attacks, including [CSRF tokens](/blog/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF#csrf_tokens), using [fetch metadata](/blog/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF#fetch_metadata) to block certain cross-site requests, and [setting the `SameSite` attribute](/blog/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF#defense_in_depth_samesite_cookies) on cookies used to authenticate sensitive requests.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Cross-site request forgery](/blog/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF)\n- [Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) at [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/)\n","slug":"6e36e685c90d4f31b50df2df898c4df3","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:25.586Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:25.586Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

CSR is opposed to {{glossary(\"SSR\", \"server-side rendering\")}}, where the server generates the HTML content. Both techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used together in the same application.\n\nA pure CSR app may return the following HTML content:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My App</title>\n    <script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"root\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <p>This app requires JavaScript to run.</p>\n    </noscript>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThen, the actual page content is generated by JavaScript in `bundle.js`, using [DOM manipulation](/blog/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).\n\nBenefits of CSR include:\n\n- Interactivity: any page update, including route transitions, do not require a full page reload. This makes the app feel faster and more responsive.\n- Performance: the server only needs to send the initial HTML content and JavaScript assets. Subsequent page updates can be fetched from an API, which can be faster than fetching a full HTML page, and causes less load on the server.\n\nBoth SSR and CSR have their performance tradeoffs, and a mix of SSR and CSR can be used to combine the benefits of both techniques. For example, the server can generate a page skeleton with empty placeholders, and the client can fetch additional data and update the page as needed.\n\nNote that {{glossary(\"SPA\", \"single-page applications\")}} do not require the site to be CSR. Modern frameworks, such as [React](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/React_getting_started), [Vue](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Vue_getting_started), and [Svelte](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Svelte_getting_started), can be used to build SPAs with SSR capabilities.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Introduction to client-side frameworks > server-side rendering](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Introduction#server-side_rendering)\n- [Client-side rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_rendering) on Wikipedia\n- {{glossary(\"SSR\", \"Server-side rendering\")}}\n- {{glossary(\"SSG\", \"Static site generator\")}}\n- {{glossary(\"SPA\", \"Single-page application\")}}\n","slug":"d0e54c61781f4b219f5c9860eb3101be","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:25.079Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:25.079Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

The W3C coordinates companies in the industry to make sure they implement the same W3C standards.\n\nEach standard passes through four stages of maturity: Working Draft (WD), Candidate Recommendation (CR), Proposed Recommendation (PR), and W3C Recommendation (REC).\n\n## See also\n\n- [W3C website](https://www.w3.org/)\n- [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"a0979c14a580418f9767b7b63b34c07d","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:25.109Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:25.109Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

In Unicode, a code point is expressed in the form \"U+1234\" where \"1234\" is the assigned number. For example, the character \"A\" is assigned a code point of U+0041.\n\nCharacter encoding forms, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, determine how a Unicode code point should be encoded as a sequence of bytes. Different encoding forms may encode the same code point as different byte sequences: for example, the Cyrillic character \"Ð¤\", whose code point is U+0424, is encoded as `0xd0a4` in UTF-8 and as `0x0424` in UTF-16.\n\n## See also\n\n- [The Unicode Standard: Code Points and Characters](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch02.pdf#G25564)\n","slug":"d32022909703436eae1737b147b01e05","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:09.265Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:09.265Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

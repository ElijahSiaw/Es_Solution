{"title":"Cls","tag":"glossary/cls","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** is a usability metric for websites, designed by Google as one of the [Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) metrics.\n\nIt measures the extent to which users encounter unexpected layout shifts, in which elements of the page are moved in an unexpected way: that is, that are not the result of a user action like pressing a button or part of an animation.\n\nLayout shifts may be caused, for example, by {{htmlelement(\"img\")}} or {{htmlelement(\"video\")}} elements that are not given `width` and `height` attributes, so the browser doesn't know how much space they will occupy until they are loaded.\n\nThe {{domxref(\"LayoutShift\")}} interface, part of the [Performance API](/blog/Web/API/Performance_API), can be used to measure individual layout shifts, which can then be used to calculate the CLS score for a web page.\n\n## See also\n\n- [CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls) on web.dev\n","slug":"f9cdc0458cba465193d52f511eaa4470","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:08.338Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:08.339Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

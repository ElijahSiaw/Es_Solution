{"title":"Snake case","tag":"glossary/snake_case","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Snake case** is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where spaces are replaced with underscores `_`, and the words are typically all lower case. It's often stylized as \"snake_case\" to remind the reader of its appearance.\n\nSnake casing is often used as a variable naming convention. The following names are in snake case: `left_shift`, `bitwise_invert`, `matrix_transpose`.\n\nNote that snake case never contains upper case letters. Sometimes, constants are written in all-uppercase, such as JavaScript's {{jsxref(\"Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER\")}}. This is not typically considered as snake case. Instead, it is sometimes called _screaming snake case_.\n\nSnake case is the most popular convention in Python, Rust, and various other languages.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Camel case\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Kebab case\")}}\n- [typescript-eslint rule: `naming-convention`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/naming-convention/)\n","slug":"e03efe4502b34d31bc801ade74b7d53e","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:16.373Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:16.373Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

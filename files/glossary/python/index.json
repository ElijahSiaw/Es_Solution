{"title":"Python","tag":"glossary/python","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Python** is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.\n\nIt was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990, and is currently used on a large array of domains like web development, desktop applications, data science, DevOps, and automation/productivity.\n\nPython is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>) on Wikipedia\n- [Official Python docs tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)\n- [Tutorials Point Python tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)\n- [AlphaCodingSkills Python Tutorial](https://www.alphacodingskills.com/python/python-tutorial.php)\n- [Django Web Framework (Python)](/blog/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Django) on Es Solution\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Java\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"JavaScript\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"PHP\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Ruby\")}}\n","slug":"bfc514f3d0484e669c52d5a9d5c5c261","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:08.731Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:08.731Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

They are sometimes called _atoms_.\n\nBecause a symbol is unique and unforgeable, you can only read a property value associated with a symbol if you have a reference to the original identifier.\n\nIn JavaScript, `symbol` is one of the {{Glossary(\"primitive\", \"primitive types\")}} and can be created using the [`Symbol()`](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) factory method that returns a different symbol each time. They can be used as keys for objects which can never accidentally collide with other properties.\n\nJavaScript also defines two other categories of symbols: well-known symbols and registered symbols. Read the {{jsxref(\"Symbol\")}} reference for more information.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) on Wikipedia\n- [Symbol](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(programming)>) on Wikipedia\n- The JavaScript global object {{jsxref(\"Symbol\")}}\n","slug":"edbe4c150b494627b094f192b47cf375","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:19.332Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:19.332Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

A color wheel can display colors identified by two polar coordinates, the _angle_ and the _distance_ from the origin, the circle's center.\n\nColor wheels are convenient for comparing colors expressed in polar or cylindrical coordinates, like [`hsl()`](/blog/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](/blog/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), or [`lch()`](/blog/Web/CSS/color_value/lch).\n\nIn such cases, _complementary colors_ are often found opposite on the same diameter. Similarly, _monochromatic colors_ – colors of the same _tone_ but of different _shades_ – are located on the same radius, and _triadic colors_ – three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel that lead to colors that work well together – are also easy to find.\n\nColor wheels are used in real life when we want to choose between different hues. For example, when selecting wall paint or the color for a piece of furniture.\n\nIn the digital world, color wheels are used in _color pickers_, like the default one on macOS:\n\n![The default color picker on macOS](color_wheel_macos.png)\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Color space\")}}\n- [`<color>`](/blog/Web/CSS/color_value) the CSS data type\n- [Color theory and the color wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)\n- [How to Use the Color Wheel to Pick Your Perfect Color Palette](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/color/basics/color-wheel-color-chart/) on Better Homes & Gardens\n- [Color wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"9bddebd4b3fe4f918fab0f423cfc81c9","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:11.588Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:11.588Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

Browsers can infer this automatically for some resources, such as the current URL in the address bar.\n\nThis can be done using [`<link rel=\"prefetch\">`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/prefetch) (the [Speculation Rules API](/blog/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) only handles document prefetches for navigations):\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"next.html\" />\n```\n\n### Document prefetching\n\nDevelopers can provide hints to the browser of navigations that should be prefetched in a couple of different ways:\n\n[`<link rel=\"prefetch\">`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/prefetch):\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"next.html\" />\n```\n\n[Speculation Rules API](/blog/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) prefetch:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"speculationrules\">\n  {\n    \"prefetch\": [\n      {\n        \"source\": \"list\",\n        \"urls\": [\"next.html\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThe Speculation Rules API handles document prefetches for navigations much better than `<link rel=\"prefetch\">`; the former was designed specifically for that purpose whereas the latter has a number of limitations; see [`<link rel=\"prefetch\">`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/prefetch) for details.\n\n### DNS prefetching\n\n[DNS prefetching](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/dns-prefetch) resolves domain names in advance, speeding up load times by reducing the time associated with domain lookup at request time.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"dns-prefetch\" href=\"https://example.com/\" />\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Speculative loading](/blog/Web/Performance/Guides/Speculative_loading)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Prerender\")}}\n- [Speculation Rules API](/blog/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API)\n","slug":"8bcfd64f796f4a2b9a2882e2510f2a7e","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:06.084Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:06.084Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

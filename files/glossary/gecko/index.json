{"title":"Gecko","tag":"glossary/gecko","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Gecko** is the layout engine developed by the Mozilla Project and used in many apps/devices, including {{glossary(\"Mozilla Firefox\",\"Firefox\")}} and {{glossary(\"Firefox OS\")}}.\n\nWeb {{glossary(\"browser\",\"browsers\")}} need software called a layout engine to interpret {{glossary(\"HTML\")}}, {{glossary(\"CSS\")}}, {{glossary(\"JavaScript\")}}, and embedded content (like images) and draw everything to your screen. Besides this, Gecko makes sure associated {{glossary(\"API\",\"APIs\")}} work well on every operating system Gecko supports, and that appropriate APIs are exposed only to relevant support targets. This means that Gecko includes, among other things, a networking stack, graphics stack, layout engine, a JavaScript virtual machine, and porting layers.\n\nSince all Firefox OS apps are Web apps, Firefox OS uses Gecko as its app runtime as well.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Gecko](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)>) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"fa95379199da4e03b0b7d19207733981","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:10.281Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:10.281Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

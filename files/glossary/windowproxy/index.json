A `WindowProxy` object exists in every {{Glossary(\"browsing context\")}}. All operations performed on a `WindowProxy` object will also be applied to the underlying `Window` object it currently wraps. Therefore, interacting with a `WindowProxy` object is almost identical to directly interacting with a `Window` object. When a browsing context is navigated, the `Window` object its `WindowProxy` wraps is changed.\n\n## See also\n\n- HTML specification: [WindowProxy section](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#the-windowproxy-exotic-object)\n- Stack Overflow question: [WindowProxy and Window objects?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16092835/windowproxy-and-window-objects)\n","slug":"5440f638f0b84562ac0f0e5a746e2b6d","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:26.908Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:26.908Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

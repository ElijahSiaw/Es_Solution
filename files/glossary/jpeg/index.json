{"title":"Jpeg","tag":"glossary/jpeg","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**JPEG** (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images.\n\nJPEG compression is composed of three compression techniques applied in successive layers, including chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transformation and quantization, and run-length Delta & Huffman encoding. Chroma subsampling involves implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for color differences than for luminance. A discrete cosine transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.\n\n## See also\n\n- [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"baa8fdfe86c141b3827732aa715f6fb1","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:52.805Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:52.805Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

So if the garbage collector found A to be unreachable and eligible for reclaiming, than B would also be unreachable and eligible for reclaiming. So objects that A dominates contribute to the retained size of A: that is, the total amount of memory that could be freed if A itself were freed.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Dominator](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_(graph_theory)>) on Wikipedia\n- [Dominators](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/memory/dominators/index.html)\n- [Garbage collection](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Memory_management#garbage_collection)\n","slug":"0d473113b50e42238bb856ff28a8ccff","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:41.233Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:41.233Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

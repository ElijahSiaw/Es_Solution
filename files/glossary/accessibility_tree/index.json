The DOM tree contains objects representing all the markup's elements, attributes, and text nodes. Browsers then create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility APIs to provide a representation that can be understood by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.\n\nThere are four properties in an accessibility tree object:\n\n- **name**\n  - : How can we refer to this thing? For instance, a link with the text \"Read more\" will have \"Read more\" as its name (find more on how names are computed in the [Accessible Name and Description Computation spec](https://w3c.github.io/accname/)).\n- **description**\n  - : How do we describe this thing, if we want to provide more description beyond the name? The description of a table could explain what kind of information the table contains.\n- [**role**](/blog/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles)\n  - : What kind of thing is it? For example, is it a button, a nav bar, or a list of items?\n- [**state**](/blog/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes)\n  - : Does it have a state? Examples include checked or unchecked checkbox states and collapsed or expanded states for the [`<summary>`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/summary) element.\n\nAdditionally, the accessibility tree often contains information on what can be done with an element: a link can be _followed_, a text input can be _typed into_, etc.\n\nWhile still in draft form within the Web Incubator Community Group as of April 2022, the **[Accessibility Object Model](https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html) (AOM)** intends to incubate APIs that make it easier to express accessibility semantics and potentially allow read access to the computed accessibility tree.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Accessibility](/blog/Web/Accessibility)\n- [Learn accessibility](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility)\n- [Web accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility) on Wikipedia\n- [Web Accessibility In Mind](https://webaim.org/)\n- [ARIA](/blog/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)\n- [The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)\n- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://w3c.github.io/aria/)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessibility\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessible description\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessible name\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"ARIA\")}}\n","slug":"82372a7ca0ed4741ae94fa96c31cd064","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.681Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.681Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Lossless compression","tag":"glossary/lossless_compression","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Lossless compression** is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. Lossless compression methods are reversible. Examples of lossless compression include {{glossary(\"GZip_compression\", \"gzip\")}}, {{glossary(\"Brotli_compression\", \"brotli\")}}, {{glossary(\"Zstandard compression\", \"Zstandard\")}}, {{glossary(\"WebP\")}}, and {{glossary(\"PNG\")}}.\n\n{{glossary(\"Lossy compression\")}}, on the other hand, uses inexact approximations by discarding some data from the original file, making it an irreversible compression method.\nCompression methods such as {{glossary(\"WebP\")}} are capable of [both lossy and lossless compression](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/compression) depending on the compression level or the options you want to use during encoding.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Lossy compression\")}}\n","slug":"b300c8b2b5484733b57ae8fbc003ae32","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.082Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.082Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

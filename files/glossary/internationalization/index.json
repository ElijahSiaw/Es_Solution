{"title":"Internationalization","tag":"glossary/internationalization","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Internationalization**, often shortened to \"i18n\", is the practice of designing a system in such a way that it can easily be adapted for different target audiences, that may vary in region, language, or culture.\n\nThe complementary process of adapting a system for a specific target audience is called {{glossary(\"Localization\")}}.\n\nAmong other things, internationalization covers adapting to differences in:\n\n- writing systems\n- units of measure (currency, °C/°F, km/miles, etc.)\n- time and date formats\n- keyboard layouts\n\nThe work of the [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org/) is a fundamental part of internationalization. Unicode supports not only variations among the world's writing systems but also cultural variations such as currencies and time/date formats.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Localization\")}}\n- [W3C Internationalization Activity](https://www.w3.org/International/)\n- [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org/)\n- [JavaScript Internationalization API](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)\n","slug":"e494088de130419cbe9e1981217206d7","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:44.975Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:44.975Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

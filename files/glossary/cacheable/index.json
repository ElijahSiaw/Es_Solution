Not all HTTP responses can be cached; these are the constraints for an HTTP response to be cacheable:\n\n- The method used in the request is _cacheable_, that is either a {{HTTPMethod(\"GET\")}} or a {{HTTPMethod(\"HEAD\")}} method. A response to a {{HTTPMethod(\"POST\")}} or {{HTTPMethod(\"PATCH\")}} request can also be cached if freshness is indicated and the {{HTTPHeader(\"Content-Location\")}} header is set, but this is rarely implemented. For example, Firefox does not support it ([Firefox bug 109553](https://bugzil.la/109553)). Other methods, like {{HTTPMethod(\"PUT\")}} or {{HTTPMethod(\"DELETE\")}} are not cacheable and their result cannot be cached.\n- The status code of the response is _known_ by the application caching, and is _cacheable_. The following status codes are cacheable: {{HTTPStatus(\"200\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"203\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"204\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"206\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"300\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"301\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"404\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"405\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"410\")}}, {{HTTPStatus(\"414\")}}, and {{HTTPStatus(\"501\")}}.\n- There are no specific headers in the response, like {{HTTPHeader(\"Cache-Control\")}}, with values that would prohibit caching.\n\nNote that some requests with non-cacheable responses to a specific URI may invalidate previously cached responses from the same URI. For example, a {{HTTPMethod(\"PUT\")}} to `/pageX.html` will invalidate all cached responses to {{HTTPMethod(\"GET\")}} or {{HTTPMethod(\"HEAD\")}} requests to `/pageX.html`.\n\nWhen both the method of the request and the status of the response are cacheable, the response to the request can be cached:\n\n```http\nGET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1\n(…)\n\n200 OK\n(…)\n```\n\nThe response to a {{HTTPMethod(\"PUT\")}} request cannot be cached. Moreover, it invalidates cached data for requests to the same URI using {{HTTPMethod(\"HEAD\")}} or {{HTTPMethod(\"GET\")}} methods:\n\n```http\nPUT /pageX.html HTTP/1.1\n(…)\n\n200 OK\n(…)\n```\n\nThe presence of the {{HTTPHeader(\"Cache-Control\")}} header with a particular value in the response can prevent caching:\n\n```http\nGET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1\n(…)\n\n200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache\n(…)\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- Details about [methods and caching](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#rfc.section.9.2.3) are provided in the HTTP specification.\n- Description of common cacheable methods: {{HTTPMethod(\"GET\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"HEAD\")}}\n- Description of common non-cacheable methods: {{HTTPMethod(\"PUT\")}}, {{HTTPMethod(\"DELETE\")}}, often {{HTTPMethod(\"POST\")}}\n","slug":"b9f96c04be684189b463cf9b808e8c3d","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:58.607Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:58.607Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

JavaScript had a choice between a string or a number and decided to use a string.\n\nThe compiler could have coerced the `5` into a number and returned a sum of `14`, but it did not. To return this result, you'd have to explicitly convert the `5` to a number using the {{jsxref(\"Global_Objects/Number\", \"Number()\")}} method:\n\n```js\nsum = Number(value1) + value2;\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Type conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion) (Wikipedia)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Type\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Type conversion\")}}\n","slug":"b4cabbfbd2cf433d9bf82f1fb7f4ceb7","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:22.620Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:22.620Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

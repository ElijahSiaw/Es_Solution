The attacker steals a valid session ID in order to break into the system and snoop data.\n\nMost authentication occurs only at the start of a {{glossary(\"TCP\")}} session. In TCP session hijacking, an attacker gains access by taking over a TCP session between two machines in mid session.\n\n![The attacker sniffs and accesses a legitimate session id from a user interacting with a web server, then uses that session identifier to spoof the session between the regular user and the server to exploit the user's session and access the server directly.](session_hijacking_3.jpg)\n\n### Session hijacking occurs because\n\n- no account lockout for invalid session IDs\n- weak session-ID generation algorithm\n- insecure handling\n- indefinite session expiration time\n- short session IDs\n- transmission in plain text\n\n### Session hijacking process\n\n1. **Sniff**, that is perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, place yourself between victim and server.\n2. **Monitor** packets flowing between server and user.\n3. **Break** the victim machine's connection.\n4. **Take control** of the session.\n5. **Inject** new packets to the server using the Victim's Session ID.\n\n### Protection against session hijacking\n\n- create a secure communication channel with SSH (secure shell)\n- pass authentication cookies over HTTPS connection\n- implement logout functionality so the user can end the session\n- generate the session ID after successful login\n- pass encrypted data between the users and the web server\n- use a string or long random number as a session key\n\n## See also\n\n- [Session hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"c894cd7965554e918b04de5388ee37c7","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.158Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.158Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

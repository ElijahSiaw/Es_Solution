Speed Index is dependent on size of the viewport and expressed in milliseconds: the lower amount of time the better the score.\n\nSpeed Index was introduced to address issues with other milestones and metrics and provide a gauge of real user experience. Speed Index has been implemented in several common audits including [WebPageTest](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest.docs/blob/main/src/metrics/SpeedIndex.md) and [Lighthouse](https://github.com/paulirish/speedline).\n\nSpeed Index is calculated by what percent of the page is visually complete at every 100ms interval until the page is visually complete. The overall score is a sum of the individual 10 times per second intervals of the percent of the screen that is not visually complete.\n\n_Diagram showing how above the fold content can load before the page load event and is measured by Speed Index_:\n![Calculation of SpeedIndex](speedindex.png)\n\n## See also\n\n- [Learn: Web performance](/blog/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Performance)\n","slug":"06e0c56768a0498f99a55d9e94ed372f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:17.123Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:17.123Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

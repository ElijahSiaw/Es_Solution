{"title":"Port","tag":"glossary/port","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nFor a computer connected to a network with an {{Glossary(\"IP address\")}}, a **port** is a communication endpoint. Ports are designated by numbers, and below 1024 each port is associated by default with a specific {{Glossary(\"protocol\")}}.\n\nFor example, the default port for the {{Glossary(\"HTTP\")}} protocol is 80 and the default port for the HTTPS protocol is 443, so a {{Glossary(\"HTTP\")}} server waits for requests on those ports. Each Internet protocol is associated with a default port: {{Glossary(\"SMTP\")}} (25), {{Glossary(\"POP\")}} (110), {{Glossary(\"IMAP\")}} (143), {{Glossary(\"IRC\")}} (194), and so on.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Port](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)>) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"43f6d513b3b14dcb92a50b8809359ac6","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:05.949Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:05.950Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

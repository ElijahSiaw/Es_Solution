{"title":"Rsync","tag":"glossary/rsync","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n[Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) is an open-source file synchronizing tool that provides incremental file transfer. It can be used over insecure and secure transports (like SSH). It is available on most Unix-based systems (such as macOS and Linux) and Windows. There are also GUI-based tools that use rsync, for example, [Acrosync](https://acrosync.com/mac.html).\n\nA basic command looks like this:\n\n```bash\nrsync [-options] SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION\n```\n\n- `-options` is a dash followed by one or more letters, for example `-v` for verbose error messages, and `-b` to make backups. See the full list of options at the [rsync man page.](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) (Search for \"Options summary.\")\n- `SOURCE` is the path to the local file or directory that you want to copy or synchronize\n- `user@` is the credentials of the user on the remote server you want to copy files over to.\n- `x.x.x.x` is the IP address of the remote server.\n- `DESTINATION` is the path to the location you want to copy your directory or files to on the remote server.\n\nYou can also make a connection over SSH using the `-e` option as shown:\n\n```bash\nrsync [-options] -e \"ssh [SSH DETAILS GO HERE]\" SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION\n```\n\nThere are numerous examples on the Internet, including those at the [official website](https://rsync.samba.org/examples.html), and at the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync#Examples) for rsync.\n","slug":"6ed50f50bc314666999abb3e5f246402","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.295Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.295Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

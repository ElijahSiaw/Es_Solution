The RTT between a network and server can be determined by using the `ping` command.\n\n```bash\nping example.com\n```\n\nThis will output something like:\n\n```plain\nPING example.com (216.58.194.174): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.174: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=25.050 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.174: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=23.781 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.174: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=24.287 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.174: icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=34.904 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.174: icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=26.119 ms\n\n5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 23.781/26.828/34.904/4.114 ms\n```\n\nIn the above example, the average round trip time is shown on the final line as 26.8ms.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Time to First Byte\")}} (TTFB)\n  - {{Glossary(\"Latency\")}}\n","slug":"cc31e3f3f79a43458d286083542f9dc2","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.041Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.041Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

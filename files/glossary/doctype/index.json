Its sole purpose is to prevent a {{Glossary(\"browser\")}} from switching into so-called [\"quirks mode\"](/blog/Web/HTML/Guides/Quirks_mode_and_standards_mode) when rendering a document; that is, the `<!doctype html>` doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.\n\nThe doctype is case-insensitive. The convention of Es Solution code examples is to use lowercase, but it's also common to write it as `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Definition of the DOCTYPE in the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype)\n- [Quirks Mode and Standards Mode](/blog/Web/HTML/Guides/Quirks_mode_and_standards_mode)\n- [Document.doctype](/blog/Web/API/Document/doctype), a JavaScript method that returns the doctype\n","slug":"23aedf0ea1694b0d9447e986f5b95e27","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:37.539Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:37.539Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Escape character","tag":"glossary/escape_character","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nAn **escape character** is a {{glossary(\"character\")}} that causes one or more characters that follow it to be interpreted differently. This forms an **escape sequence**, which is often used to represent a character that has an alternative meaning when printed literally, such as the quote character in a string literal. Escape sequences can have other usages too, especially in [regular expressions](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions#escape_sequences).\n\n- In JavaScript [regexes](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_escape), [string literals](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#string_literals), and [identifiers](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#identifiers), we can use the backslash (`\\`) to escape characters like `\\'`, `\\\"`, `\\u0026`, etc.\n- In CSS identifiers, we can use the backslash (`\\`) to escape characters like `\\\\`, `\\n`, `\\26`, etc. See [escape characters](/blog/Web/CSS/ident#escaping_characters) for more information.\n- In HTML text content and attribute values, we can use {{glossary(\"character reference\", \"character references\")}} like `&lt;`, `&#60;`, or `&#x3C;`.\n- In {{glossary(\"URL\", \"URLs\")}}, we can use the percent sign (`%`) to escape characters like `%20`, `%3C`, `%3E`, etc.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Character\")}}\n  - {{glossary(\"Character reference\")}}\n  - {{glossary(\"Code point\")}}\n- [Escape character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) on Wikipedia\n- [Escape sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"f5d13c2cb31c45dfb898a06926d61ea5","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:51.566Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:51.566Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Html","tag":"glossary/html","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.\n\n## Brief history\n\nIn 1990, as part of his vision of the {{Glossary(\"World Wide Web\",\"Web\")}}, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of {{Glossary(\"hypertext\")}}, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on {{Glossary(\"SGML\")}}. The {{Glossary(\"IETF\")}} began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the {{Glossary(\"W3C\")}} to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an {{Glossary(\"ISO\")}} standard in 2000.\n\nAt that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of {{Glossary(\"XHTML\")}}, prompting the founding of an independent group called {{Glossary(\"WHATWG\")}} in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML continued: the two organizations released the first draft of {{Glossary(\"HTML5\")}} in 2008 and an official standard in 2014. The term \"HTML5\" is just a buzzword referring to modern web technologies which are part of the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).\n\n## Concept and syntax\n\nAn HTML document is a plaintext document structured with {{Glossary(\"element\",\"elements\")}}. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing {{Glossary(\"tag\",\"tags\")}}. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (`<>`). There are a few empty or _void_ elements that cannot enclose any text, for instance {{htmlelement(\"img\")}}.\n\nYou can extend HTML tags with {{Glossary(\"attribute\",\"attributes\")}}, which provide additional information affecting how the browser interprets the element:\n\n![Detail of the structure of an HTML element](anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)\n\nAn HTML file is normally saved with an `.htm` or `.html` extension, served by a {{Glossary(\"Server\",\"web server\")}}, and can be rendered by any {{Glossary(\"Browser\",\"Web browser\")}}.\n\n## See also\n\n- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) on Wikipedia\n- [Our HTML tutorial](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content)\n- [The web course on codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)\n- [The HTML documentation on Es Solution](/blog/Web/HTML)\n- [The HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)\n","slug":"046e6e777198450eb02a44c7a71bff77","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:27.809Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:27.809Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

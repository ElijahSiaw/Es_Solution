{"title":"Cipher","tag":"glossary/cipher","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn {{glossary(\"cryptography\")}}, a **cipher** is an algorithm that can {{glossary(\"encryption\", \"encrypt\")}} {{glossary(\"plaintext\")}} to make it unreadable, and to {{glossary(\"decryption\", \"decrypt\")}} the encoded data back to plaintext again.\n\nCiphers were common long before the information age (e.g., [substitution ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher), [transposition ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher), and [permutation ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_cipher)), but none of them were cryptographically secure except for the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).\n\nIn the modern age, ciphers have evolved dramatically. [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), [RSA](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>) and [Blowfish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)>) are examples of ciphers that are integral part of contemporary encryption standards and systems.\n\nModern ciphers are designed to withstand attacks discovered through {{glossary(\"cryptanalysis\")}}. There is no guarantee that all attack methods have been discovered, so each algorithm is [recommended for different purposes](/blog/Web/API/SubtleCrypto#supported_algorithms) based on known classes of attacks.\n\nCiphers operate either as [block ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher) on successive blocks (or buffers) of data, or as [stream ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher) on a continuous data flow (often of sound or video).\n\nCiphers are also classified according to how their {{glossary(\"key\", \"keys\")}} are handled:\n\n- {{Glossary(\"Symmetric-key cryptography\", \"symmetric key\")}} algorithms use the same key to encode and decode a message. The key also must be sent securely if the message is to stay confidential.\n- {{Glossary(\"Public-key cryptography\", \"asymmetric key\")}} algorithms use one key for encryption and the other for decryption.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Web Crypto API](/blog/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)\n- [SubtleCrypto supported algorithms](/blog/Web/API/SubtleCrypto#supported_algorithms)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Block cipher mode of operation\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Ciphertext\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Cipher suite\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Cryptanalysis\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Cryptography\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Decryption\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Encryption\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Key\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Plaintext\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Public-key cryptography\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Symmetric-key cryptography\")}}\n- [Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"1877b88c94d7415bbd8cbc3793a0a9d7","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:05.668Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:05.668Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Spa","tag":"glossary/spa","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nAn SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as [Fetch](/blog/Web/API/Fetch_API) when different content is to be shown.\n\nThis therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (Wikipedia)\n- [Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"API\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"AJAX\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"JavaScript\")}}\n- Popular SPA frameworks:\n  - [React](https://react.dev/)\n  - [Angular](https://angular.dev/)\n  - [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/)\n","slug":"dc0eb9ec3c30479fa1b231699aea8949","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:16.683Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:16.683Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

To see your effective connection type, open the console of the developer tools of a supporting browser and enter the following:\n\n```js\nnavigator.connection.effectiveType;\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Network Information API](/blog/Web/API/Network_Information_API)\n- {{domxref('NetworkInformation')}}\n- {{domxref('NetworkInformation.effectiveType')}}\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"ECT\")}}\n","slug":"5c46dd00f73f4702ab8af665375d2228","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:45.890Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:45.890Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Code splitting","tag":"glossary/code_splitting","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Code splitting** is the practice of splitting the code a web application depends on — including its own code and any third-party dependencies — into separate bundles that can be loaded independently of each other.\nThis allows an application to load only the code it actually needs at a given point in time, and load other bundles on demand.\nThis approach is used to improve application performance, especially on initial load.\n\nCode splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Lazy loading](/blog/Web/Performance/Guides/Lazy_loading)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"HTTP 2\", \"HTTP/2\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Tree shaking\")}}\n","slug":"43c746b0bd094bbfabb4bcb9139d9d67","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:09.725Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:09.725Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

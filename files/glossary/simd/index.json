{"title":"Simd","tag":"glossary/simd","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nSIMD (pronounced \"sim-dee\") is short for **Single Instruction/Multiple Data** which is one [classification of computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s_taxonomy). SIMD allows one same operation to be performed on multiple data points resulting in data level parallelism and thus performance gains â€” for example, for 3D graphics and video processing, physics simulations or cryptography, and other domains.\n\nSee also {{Glossary(\"SISD\")}} for a sequential architecture with no parallelism in either the instructions or the data sets.\n\n## See also\n\n- [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"SISD\")}}\n","slug":"633c702a93064bccb1cf580b7411238c","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.676Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.676Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

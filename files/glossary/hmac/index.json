{"title":"Hmac","tag":"glossary/hmac","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Hash-based message authentication code**(_HMAC_) is a mechanism used for {{Glossary(\"cryptography\", \"cryptographically\")}} authenticating messages.\n\nIt can use any kind of {{Glossary(\"Hash function\", \"cryptographic hash function\")}}. Its strength depends on the underlying hash function and the chosen secret key. With such a combination, the HMAC verification {{Glossary(\"Algorithm\", \"algorithm\")}} is then known with a compound name such as HMAC-SHA2.\n\nHMAC is used to ensure both integrity and authentication.\n\n## See also\n\n- [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) on Wikipedia\n- [RFC 2104](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104) on IETF\n","slug":"627d7e463b244d08a430dd69df92814f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:24.260Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:24.260Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

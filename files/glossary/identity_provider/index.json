These third parties are called identity providers.\n\nExamples of identity providers on the web include Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. This enables websites to allow users to sign in using the user's Google, Microsoft, or Facebook account.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Federated identity\")}}\n  - {{glossary(\"Relying party\")}}\n- [Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API](/blog/Web/API/FedCM_API)\n","slug":"0bd6b32210fe43fe936577832728bc18","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:37.128Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:37.129Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

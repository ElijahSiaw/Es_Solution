{"title":"Delta","tag":"glossary/delta","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nThe term **delta** refers to the difference between two values or states.\n\nThe name originates from the Greek letter Δ (delta), which is equivalent to the letter _D_ in the Roman alphabet. _Delta_ refers to the use of the letter Δ as a shorthand for _difference_.\n\nThe term _delta_ is commonly used when communicating changes in speed, position, or acceleration of a physical or virtual object. It's also used when describing changes in the volume or frequency of sound waves.\n\nFor example, when describing how far an object on the screen moves left-to-right, one might use the term _delta x_ or _Δx_.\n\nLikewise, given the new value of _X_ and its old value, you might compute the delta like this:\n\n```js\nlet deltaX = newX - oldX;\n```\n\nMore commonly, you receive the delta and use it to update a saved previous condition:\n\n```js\nlet newX = oldX + deltaX;\n```\n\nFor example, mouse wheel events {{domxref(\"WheelEvent\")}} offer the amount the wheel moved since the last event in its {{domxref(\"WheelEvent.deltaX\", \"deltaX\")}}, {{domxref(\"WheelEvent.deltaY\", \"deltaY\")}}, and {{domxref(\"WheelEvent.deltaZ\", \"deltaZ\")}} properties.\n","slug":"2d62f7a2c6e24fcdbc6237142c82e875","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:31.770Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:31.770Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

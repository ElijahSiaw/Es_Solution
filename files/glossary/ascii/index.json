{"title":"Ascii","tag":"glossary/ascii","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**ASCII** (_American Standard Code for Information Interchange_) is a {{glossary(\"character encoding\")}} standard using 7-bit to represent 128\n{{glossary(\"character\", \"characters\")}} used by computers and other devices for encoding letters, numbers, punctuation, and control codes into digital form.\n\nThe first 33 ASCII {{glossary(\"code point\", \"code points\")}} are non-printing control codes including the carriage return, line feed, tab, and several obsolete non-printable codes stemming from its origin of representing telegraph codes. The other 95 are printable characters, including digits (0-9), lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters, and punctuation symbols.\n\nIn the modern age, most computer systems use {{glossary(\"Unicode\")}} instead, which is an extension of ASCII, supporting millions of code points. {{Glossary(\"UTF-8\")}} superseded ASCII on the Web in 2007.\n\n## See also\n\n- [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) on Wikipedia\n- {{rfc(\"20\")}}\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Unicode\")}}\n  - {{glossary(\"UTF-8\")}}\n","slug":"d40a3cc3a57a43caa40e1f93cfb65fb3","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:50.069Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:50.069Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

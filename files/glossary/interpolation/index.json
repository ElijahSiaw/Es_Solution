{"title":"Interpolation","tag":"glossary/interpolation","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nInterpolation is a method for estimating new data points based on a set of known data points.\n\nInterpolation calculates intermediate values in animations that change HTML properties such as height, width, etc.\nColor interpolation defines intermediate values of colors in color mixing, gradients, compositing, filters, transitions, animations, and color functions.\n\nInterpolations aren't necessarily linear. Most interpolated values are real, floating-point numbers; however, when there is no mid-point between two values, such as values that accept only integers, the [interpolation is discrete](/blog/Web/CSS/integer#interpolation). The progression of interpolation also depends on [easing functions](/blog/Web/CSS/easing-function) in animations and color stops, and {{CSSXref(\"color-interpolation-method\", \"color\")}} and {{CSSXref(\"hue-interpolation-method\", \"hue\")}} interpolation methods in gradients.\n\nIn JavaScript, the term \"[interpolation](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#string_interpolation)\" is used as a description of the substitution of strings in the template literals.\n\n## See also\n\n- {{SVGAttr(\"color-interpolation\")}} SVG attribute\n- {{CSSXref(\"color-interpolation\")}} CSS property\n- {{CSSXref(\"color-interpolation-method\")}} CSS data type\n- {{CSSXref(\"hue-interpolation-method\")}} CSS data type\n- {{CSSXref(\"color_value/color-mix\", \"color-mix()\")}} CSS function\n- [Interpolating colors in CSS](/blog/Web/CSS/color_value#interpolation)\n- [Interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation) on Wikipedia\n- [String interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"0944de5cabd649d8b7a79f0203abed84","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:46.043Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:46.043Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

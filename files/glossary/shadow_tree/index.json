{"title":"Shadow tree","tag":"glossary/shadow_tree","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **shadow tree** is a hidden set of {{Glossary(\"DOM\")}} nodes whose topmost {{Glossary(\"node/dom\", \"node\")}} is a **shadow root**. The shadow root is the topmost node of a **shadow DOM** and not part of the regular document's DOM tree.\n\nThe shadow root is attached to another node tree through a specific DOM node referred to as its **host**. This host may be part of another shadow tree or part of the regular DOM tree. The node tree of a shadow root's host is sometimes referred to as the **light tree**.\n\nThe hidden DOM nodes of a shadow tree are generally not affected by anything applied outside the shadow tree, and vice versa. The **shadow boundary**, where the shadow DOM ends and the regular DOM begins, can be traversed, but only very intentionally:\n\n- Scripting shadow tree nodes from outside requires the use of a special [Shadow DOM API](/blog/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM) to be accessed.\n- Styling a shadow tree from outside can be achieved via [CSS scoping](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_scoping) and [CSS shadow parts](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_shadow_parts).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Using shadow DOM](/blog/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM)\n- {{domxref(\"Element.shadowRoot\")}} and {{domxref(\"Element.attachShadow()\")}}\n- {{domxref(\"ShadowRoot\")}}\n- {{HTMLElement(\"slot\")}}\n- [CSS shadow parts](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_shadow_parts) module\n- [CSS scoping](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_scoping) module\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessibility tree\")}}\n","slug":"e077d8dbf02441ff9b6b33535614149f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.281Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.281Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

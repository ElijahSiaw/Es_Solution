{"title":"Pop","tag":"glossary/pop","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**POP3** (Post Office Protocol) is a very common {{glossary(\"protocol\")}} for getting emails from a mail server over a {{glossary(\"TCP\")}} connection. POP3 does not support folders, unlike the more recent {{Glossary(\"IMAP\")}}, which is harder to implement because of its more complex structure.\n\nClients usually retrieve all messages and then delete them from the server, but POP3 does allow retaining a copy on the server. Nearly all email servers and clients currently support POP3.\n\n## See also\n\n- [POP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol) on Wikipedia\n- [RFC 1734](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1734) (Specification of POP3 authentication mechanism)\n- [RFC 1939](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1939) (Specification of POP3)\n- [RFC 2449](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2449) (Specification of POP3 extension mechanism)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"IMAP\")}}\n","slug":"46bef3398aa64328a511191af7773ed2","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:05.834Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:05.834Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

However, it doesn't necessarily reflect what users are experiencing.\n\nSynthetic Monitoring involves deploying scripts to simulate the path an end-user might take through a web application, reporting back the performance of the simulator experiences. Examples of popular synthetic monitoring tools include [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/). The traffic measured is not of your actual users, but rather synthetically generated traffic collecting data on page performance.\n\nUnlike {{Glossary(\"Real User Monitoring\", \"RUM\")}}, synthetic monitoring provides a narrow view of performance that doesn't account for user differences, making it useful in getting basic data about an application's performance and spot-checking performance in development environments. Combined with other tools, such as network throttling, can provide excellent insight into potential problem areas.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Real User Monitoring\")}} (RUM)\n  - {{Glossary(\"Beacon\")}}\n- [Real User Monitoring (RUM) versus Synthetic Monitoring](/blog/Web/Performance/Guides/Rum-vs-Synthetic)\n","slug":"2f4e429453754f48937a49be5b201f0a","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:19.916Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:19.917Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

It is a non-standard Google web performance metric. Generally, it occurs when most, but not necessarily all visible UI elements are interactive, and the user interface responds, on average, to most user input within 50ms.\n\n## See also\n\n- Metrics which replaced First CPU Idle:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Time to interactive\")}}\n- [Total blocking time](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/)\n","slug":"c0609c262a344ea78e78f5e55e91d745","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:59.969Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:59.969Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

It is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage. CRUD typically refers to operations performed in a database or datastore, but it can also apply to higher level functions of an application such as soft deletes where data is not actually deleted but marked as deleted via a status.\n\n## See also\n\n- [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"62ce2b91a4434a2287c1422565c6a4fa","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:22.967Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:22.967Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

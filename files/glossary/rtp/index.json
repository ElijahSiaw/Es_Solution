{"title":"Rtp","tag":"glossary/rtp","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nThe **Real-time Transport Protocol** (**RTP**) is a network protocol which described how to transmit various media (audio, video) from one endpoint to another in a real-time fashion. RTP is suitable for video-streaming application, telephony over {{glossary(\"IP\")}} like Skype and conference technologies.\n\nThe secure version of RTP, **SRTP**, is used by [WebRTC](/blog/Web/API/WebRTC_API), and uses encryption and authentication to minimize the risk of denial-of-service attacks and security breaches.\n\nRTP is rarely used alone; instead, it is used in conjunction with other protocols like {{glossary(\"RTSP\")}} and {{glossary(\"SDP\")}}.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Introduction to the Real-time Transport Protocol](/blog/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Intro_to_RTP)\n- [RTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol) on Wikipedia\n- {{RFC(3550)}} (one of the documents that specify precisely how the protocol works)\n","slug":"62f5b56a647c4467a9e105a8ad83b540","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.518Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.518Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

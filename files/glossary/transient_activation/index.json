See {{Glossary(\"Sticky activation\")}} for a user activation that doesn't reset after it has been set initially.\n\n## See also\n\n- [HTML Living Standard > Transient activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#transient-activation)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Sticky activation\")}}\n- {{domxref(\"UserActivation.isActive\")}}\n","slug":"45ed00518d8d4ab0af219d3d63271b42","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.874Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.874Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

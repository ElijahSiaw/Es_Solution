{"title":"Markup","tag":"glossary/markup","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. {{glossary(\"HTML\")}} (HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language.\n\nWithin a text file such as an HTML file, elements are _marked up_ using {{glossary(\"Tag\",\"tags\")}} which explain the purpose of that part of the content.\n\n## Types of markup language\n\n- **Presentational Markup:**\n  - : Used by traditional word processing system with WYSIWYG (what you see it is what you get); this is hidden from human authors, users and editors.\n- **Procedural Markup:**\n  - : Combined with text to provide instructions on text processing to programs. This text is visibly manipulated by the author.\n- **Descriptive Markup:**\n  - : Labels sections of documents as to how the program should handle them. For example, the HTML {{HTMLElement(\"td\")}} defines a cell in a HTML table.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"HTML\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"XHTML\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"XML\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"SVG\")}}\n","slug":"28043de3ad014fc1b31e862fef75892a","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.502Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.502Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

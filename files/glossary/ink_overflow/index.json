Being visual only, ink overflow does not affect layout as it has no impact on box model properties.\n\nInk overflow is the overflow of painting effects such as [box shadows](/blog/Web/CSS/box-shadow), [border images](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders), [text decoration](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_text_decoration), [outlines](/blog/Web/CSS/outline), etc. that do not affect layout or otherwise extend the scrollable overflow area. Ink overflow is also the overhanging of glyphs, such as ascenders and descenders extending outside the em box.\n\nAs {{ glossary(\"replaced elements\")}} always establish an independent [formatting context](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Introduction_to_formatting_contexts), any overflow of replaced content is always ink overflow (as opposed to [scrollable overflow](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Overflow)).\n\n## See also\n\n- [CSS overflow module](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_overflow)\n","slug":"f7ba7b1fcbb44ef79ab3906001a5939b","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:41.765Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:41.765Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

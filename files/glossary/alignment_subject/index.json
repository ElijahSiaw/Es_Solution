{"title":"Alignment subject","tag":"glossary/alignment_subject","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn [CSS box alignment](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment) the **alignment subject** is the thing (or things) being aligned within the {{glossary(\"alignment container\")}} by the property.\n\nFor {{cssxref(\"justify-self\")}} and {{cssxref(\"align-self\")}}, the alignment subject is the margin box of the box the property is set on, using the writing mode of that box. For {{cssxref(\"justify-content\")}} and {{cssxref(\"align-content\")}}, the writing mode of the box is also used.\n\nThe definition of the alignment subject depends on the layout mode being used.\n\n- Block containers (including table cells)\n  - : The entire content of the block as a single unit.\n- Multicol containers\n  - : The column boxes, with any spacing inserted between column boxes added to the relevant column gaps.\n- Flex containers\n  - : For {{cssxref(\"justify-content\")}}, the flex items in each flex line. For {{cssxref(\"align-content\")}}, the flex lines. Note, this only has an effect on multi-line flex containers.\n- Grid containers\n  - : The grid tracks in the appropriate axis, with any spacing inserted between tracks added to the relevant gutters. Collapsed gutters are treated as a single opportunity for space insertion.\n\n## See also\n\n- [CSS box alignment](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment) module\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"alignment container\")}}\n","slug":"131993f6ea494fc7961507355b43cb74","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.062Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.062Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

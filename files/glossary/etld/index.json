Then you would know that the following domains all belonged to the same organization:\n\n```plain\n    xyz.org\nabc.xyz.org\ndef.xyz.org\n```\n\nHowever, this does not work as a general rule, because many registrars allow organizations to register domains at levels below the top level. This means that, for example, `sussex.ac.uk` and `aber.ac.uk` are owned by different organizations.\n\nBecause this is a matter of the registrar's policies, it's impossible to tell algorithmically whether a given domain name suffix (like `ac.uk`) is publicly registrable or not. The [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) is a list of all suffixes under which organizations can directly register names: that is, it is a list of eTLDs.\n\nThe related concept **eTLD+1** means an eTLD plus the next part of the domain name. Because eTLD+1s are registrable, all domains with the same eTLD+1 are owned by the same organization.\n\nFor example, all the following are eTLD+1 domains:\n\n- crookedtimber.org\n- theguardian.com\n- sussex.ac.uk\n- aber.ac.uk\n\nThis means that all domains under each of these domains belong to the same organization. For example:\n\n```plain\n film.theguardian.com\nmusic.theguardian.com\n```\n\n```plain\n      news.sussex.ac.uk\n      blog.sussex.ac.uk\nadmissions.sussex.ac.uk\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)\n","slug":"39fd291851d041a189024d8dd39dacee","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:52.065Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:52.065Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

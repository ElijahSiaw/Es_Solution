With sticky user activation, if activation is set it is not reset for the duration of the session (unlike {{Glossary(\"Transient activation\")}}).\n\nSee [Features gated by user activation](/blog/Web/Security/User_activation) for examples of APIs that require _sticky activation_.\n\nSee the {{domxref(\"UserActivation.hasBeenActive\")}} property to programmatically access the current window's sticky activation state.\n\n## See also\n\n- [HTML Living Standard > Sticky activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sticky-activation)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Transient activation\")}}\n- {{domxref(\"UserActivation.hasBeenActive\")}}\n","slug":"3f839fadb0bb4ee19b67f534f4a06a7f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:18.460Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:18.460Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

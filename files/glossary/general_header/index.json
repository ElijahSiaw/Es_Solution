{"title":"General header","tag":"glossary/general_header","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**General header** is an outdated term used to refer to an {{glossary('HTTP_header', 'HTTP header')}} that can be used in both request and response messages, but which doesn't apply to the content itself (a header that applied to the content was called an {{glossary(\"entity header\")}}). Depending on the context they are used in, general headers might either be {{glossary(\"Response header\", \"response\")}} or {{glossary(\"request header\", \"request headers\")}} (e.g., {{HTTPheader(\"Cache-Control\")}}).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Current versions of the HTTP/1.1 specification do not specifically categorize headers as \"general headers\". These are now simply referred to as {{glossary(\"Response header\", \"response\")}} or {{glossary(\"request header\", \"request headers\")}} depending on context.\n","slug":"64101157a6c94b4fad28184e88bfd647","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:10.789Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:10.789Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

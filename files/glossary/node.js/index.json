Its command-line (CLI) client `npm` can be used to download, configure and create packages for use in Node.js projects. Downloaded packages can be imported by [ES imports](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [CommonJS `require()`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) without including the dependency directory `node_modules/` they are downloaded to, as Node.js [resolves](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-from-node_modules-folders) packages without a relative or absolute path specified in their import.\n\nPackages hosted on npm are downloaded from the registry at [https://registry.npmjs.org/](https://registry.npmjs.org/), but the CLI can be configured to use any compatible instance.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) on Wikipedia\n- [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)\n- [API reference documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/)\n- [Guides](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs)\n- [npm Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/)\n","slug":"ec7b46513dcc49798b145ad29c213b92","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:01.086Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:01.086Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

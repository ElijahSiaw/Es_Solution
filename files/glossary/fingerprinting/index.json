{"title":"Fingerprinting","tag":"glossary/fingerprinting","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Fingerprinting** is a practice in which websites identify a particular browser (and by extension, a particular user) by collecting and combining distinguishing features of the browser and underlying operating system. Elements of a fingerprint might include, for example:\n\n- the browser version\n- the timezone and preferred language\n- the set of video or audio codecs that are available on the system\n- the fonts installed on the system\n- the state of the browser's settings\n- the computer's display size and resolution\n\nA website can retrieve information like this by executing JavaScript and CSS on the device, and by combining this data can often create a unique fingerprint for a browser, which can then be used to track users across the web.\n\nWeb standards are designed in such a way as to minimize the ability of a website to collect identifying information, and browsers typically add their own protections as well.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/): a tool to show the data a website can use to fingerprint your browser.\n- [Mitigating Browser Fingerprinting in Web Specifications](https://w3c.github.io/fingerprinting-guidance/): best practices for specification authors to prevent fingerprinting.\n","slug":"87ddb29926844541a749a5af081b3e91","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:57.400Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:57.400Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

Completing the first contentful paint answers the question \"Is it happening?\"\n\n_The First Contentful Paint_ timestamp is when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), video, canvas that had been drawn into, or non-empty SVG. This excludes any content of iframes, but includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.\n\n## See also\n\n- [`PerformancePaintTiming`](/blog/Web/API/PerformancePaintTiming)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"First Paint\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Largest Contentful Paint\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"First Meaningful Paint\")}}\n- [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/fcp) at web.dev\n","slug":"038c89d4bd034522bb8c346a60cf2138","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:59.455Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:59.455Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

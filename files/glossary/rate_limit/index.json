{"title":"Rate limit","tag":"glossary/rate_limit","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn computing, especially in networking, **rate limiting** means controlling how many operations can be performed in a given amount of time, usually to avoid overloading the system and causing performance degradation. For example, a server might limit the number of requests it will accept from a single client in a given time period, which not only optimizes the server's overall performance but also mitigates attacks like {{Glossary(\"Denial of Service\", \"DoS attack\")}}.\n\nRate limiting is typically synonymous with {{glossary(\"throttle\", \"throttling\")}}, although {{glossary(\"debounce\", \"debouncing\")}} is another viable strategy which provides better semantics and user experience in certain cases.\n\n## See also\n\n- Glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Debounce\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Throttle\")}}\n- {{HTTPStatus(\"429\", \"429 Too Many Requests\")}}\n- [What is rate limiting? | Rate limiting and bots](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limiting/) on cloudflare.com\n","slug":"756ba5f45459494a96cb402823ecc8ef","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:09.458Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:09.459Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

ARPANET first ran NCP (Network Control Protocol) and subsequently the first version of the Internet protocol or {{glossary(\"TCP\")}}/{{glossary(\"IPv4\",\"IP\")}} suite, making ARPANET a prominent part of the nascent {{glossary(\"Internet\")}}. ARPANET was closed in early 1990.\n\n## See also\n\n- [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"arpa\", \".arpa\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"TCP\")}}\n","slug":"26cb20af74114cd98fc0f2cc0281df4e","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.893Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.893Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

Browsers may ignore the specified `start_url` or may allow users to change its value when adding the web app to their device's home screen or bookmarking it.\n\n## See also\n\n- [`scope`](/blog/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest/Reference/scope)\n- [Web app manifests](/blog/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest)\n- [Progressive web apps (PWA)](/blog/Web/Progressive_web_apps)\n","slug":"3c4163e306b445fd9949438d357bd363","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.478Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.478Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for e-commerce and ads).\n\nSearch engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.\n\nSEO methods fall into three broad classes:\n\n- Technical\n  - : Tag the content using semantic {{Glossary(\"HTML\")}}. When exploring the website, crawlers should only find the content you want indexed.\n- Copywriting\n  - : Write content using your visitors' vocabulary. Use text as well as images so that crawlers can understand the subject.\n- Popularity\n  - : You get most traffic when other established sites link to your site.\n\n## See also\n\n- [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEO) on Wikipedia\n- [Google Search Central](https://developers.google.com/search/docs)\n","slug":"aa0c5b074c234d4db3f55e27f87f667b","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:14.684Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:14.684Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

For example, a program that helps scientists with complex calculations, a database that stores huge amounts of data, a website that allows people to download music, or animation software that allows people to create animated movies.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) on Wikipedia\n- [List of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"306a0574d49c4d6f8caaaafdbee6b634","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:14.152Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:14.152Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

It is the frames per second and times the main thread is not available for user interactions. Subjectively, it is the user's perception of whether the time it takes between the time the user requests the content and the time until the user feels the content requested is available and usable _feels_ slow or fast.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Web performance](/blog/Web/Performance) guides\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Perceived performance\")}}\n","slug":"c72b55bc48ae429dba79104bffe46120","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:25.414Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:25.414Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

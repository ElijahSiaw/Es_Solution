{"title":"Challenge","tag":"glossary/challenge","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn security protocols, a **challenge** is some data sent to the client by the server in order to generate a different response each time. Challenge-response protocols are one way to fight against {{glossary(\"replay attack\", \"replay attacks\")}} where an attacker listens to the previous messages and resends them at a later time to get the same credentials as the original message.\n\nThe [HTTP authentication protocol](/blog/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication) is challenge-response based, though the \"Basic\" protocol isn't using a real challenge (the realm is always the same).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Challenge-response authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication) on Wikipedia.\n","slug":"df70d658742b455790b115c8071a9638","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:02.919Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:02.919Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

For example, `en` specifies English, but `en-GB` and `en-US` more precisely specify British English and American English, respectively.\n\nBCP 47 language tags are used anywhere on the web platform where a feature has been designed to output different results depending on the specified language, enabling {{glossary(\"internationalization\")}} support.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- The HTML [`lang`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) attribute\n- The HTML {{htmlelement(\"track\")}} element\n- The {{jsxref(\"Temporal\")}} object\n- The {{domxref(\"CanvasRenderingContext2D.lang\")}} property\n- The [Translator and Language Detector APIs](/blog/Web/API/Translator_and_Language_Detector_APIs)\n\n## BCP 47 syntax\n\nThe full BCP 47 syntax is specified in {{rfc(\"5646\")}}. It is capable of identifying extremely specific language dialects, but most usage is much simpler.\n\nA language tag is made of hyphen-separated _subtags_, where each subtag indicates a certain property of the language. The three most common subtags are:\n\n- Language subtag\n  - : A 2-or-3-character code that defines the basic language, typically written in all lowercase. For example, the language code for English is `en`, and the code for Badeshi is `bdz`.\n- Script subtag {{optional_inline}}\n\n  - : This subtag defines the writing system used for the language, and is always 4 characters long, with the first letter capitalized. For example, French-in-Braille is `fr-Brai` and Japanese written with the Katakana alphabet is `ja-Kana`.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > If the language is written in a highly typical way, like English in the Latin alphabet, there is no need to use this subtag.\n\n- Region subtag {{optional_inline}}\n  - : This subtag defines a dialect of the base language from a particular location and is either two upper-case letters matching a country code or three numbers matching a non-country area. For example, `es-ES` is for Spanish as spoken in Spain, and `es-013` is Spanish as spoken in Central America. \"International Spanish\" would just be `es`.\n\nThe script subtag precedes the region subtag if both are present â€” `ru-Cyrl-BY` is Russian, written in the Cyrillic alphabet, as spoken in Belarus.\n\n## See also\n\n- [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646): where BCP 47 language tags are specified.\n- [BCP 47 language subtag lookup](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/): look up subtag codes for a language.\n","slug":"f18aa116b9684965b5e3c5a503868e20","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:51.818Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:51.818Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

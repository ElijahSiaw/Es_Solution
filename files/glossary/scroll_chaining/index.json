This behavior creates a continuous scrolling experience, both vertically and horizontally.\n\nA **scroll chain** is the order of scrollable elements where the scrolling action passes from one element to another. This happens when an inner element is scrolled to its limit, and the scrolling continues to its parent element, creating a 'chain' of scrolling actions. Chaining typically recurses up the containing block.\n\n## See also\n\n- {{CSSxRef(\"overscroll-behavior\")}} CSS property\n- [CSS overflow](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_overflow) module\n- [CSS overscroll behavior](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_overscroll_behavior) module\n- [CSS scroll snap](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap) module\n- [CSS scroll anchoring](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_anchoring) module\n","slug":"405bdcc7b3874ca0b3c057689da68d71","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:13.705Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:13.706Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

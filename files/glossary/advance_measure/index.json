It is equal to the distance traveled by the cursor, placed directly in front of and then shifted behind the character.\n\nThis term is used in the definition of several CSS {{cssxref(\"&lt;length&gt;\")}} units.\nThe _advance measure_ of unit `ch` is either the width or height of character \"0\" in the given typeface, depending on whether the horizontal or vertical axis is currently used. A similar _advance measure_ of unit `ic` is the width or height of the \"æ°´\" character.\n\n## See also\n\n- {{cssxref(\"&lt;length&gt;\")}}\n- [Learn: CSS values and units](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Values_and_units)\n- [TextMetrics API](/blog/Web/API/TextMetrics)\n","slug":"f8fe88f1adaa4f8ab888fe2fbb572fc4","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.815Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.815Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Deno","tag":"glossary/deno","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Deno** is a runtime environment for {{Glossary(\"JavaScript\")}}, {{Glossary(\"TypeScript\")}}, and {{glossary(\"WebAssembly\")}}.\n\nLike {{glossary(\"Node.js\")}}, Deno is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and enables developers to run JavaScript outside browsers. However, there are some notable differences between Node and Deno. In particular, Deno:\n\n- Has built-in support for TypeScript.\n- Restricts file system and network access by default.\n- Includes a large standard library, including implementations of many Web APIs.\n- Does not depend on a centralized registry, instead allowing modules to be loaded from URLs.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Deno website](https://deno.com/)\n","slug":"9d870cab154848c58d5b3db6c69e610f","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:32.812Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:32.813Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

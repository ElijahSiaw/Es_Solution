{"title":"Sdk","tag":"glossary/sdk","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nAn **SDK** (**Software Development Kit**) is an integrated collection of tools that a developer can use to create software for a specific framework, operating system, or other platform. An SDK can include:\n\n- An editor\n- A compiler\n- A debugger\n- An emulator or simulator, if the target platform is different from the platform used to create the program.\n- Tools to help test and package the program for distribution.\n\nSDKs are usually provided by the owner of a software platform, to support developers targeting the platform. For example, Google provides an [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) for developers writing Android apps.\n\nIn many respects, the {{Glossary(\"developer tools\")}} built into modern web browsers provide a similar function for web developers.\n","slug":"8fa20d7612de4c3ca347929893432a02","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:14.225Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:14.225Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

Screen readers are essential to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability. There are some browser extension screen readers, but most screen readers operate system-wide for all user applications, not just the browser.\n\nIn terms of web {{glossary(\"accessibility\")}}, most user agents provide an accessibility object model and screen readers interact with dedicated accessibility APIs, using various operating system features and employing hooking techniques.\n\n## Common screen readers\n\n### VoiceOver\n\niOS and macOS comes with VoiceOver, a built-in screen reader.

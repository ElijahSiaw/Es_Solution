{"title":"Utf-8","tag":"glossary/utf-8","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nUTF-8 (UCS Transformation Format 8) is the World Wide Web's most common {{Glossary(\"Character encoding\", \"character encoding\")}}. Each character is represented by one to four bytes. UTF-8 is backward-compatible with {{Glossary(\"ASCII\")}} and can represent any standard Unicode character.\n\nThe first 128 UTF-8 characters precisely match the first 128 ASCII characters (numbered 0-127), meaning that existing ASCII text is already valid UTF-8. All other characters use two to four bytes. Each byte has some bits reserved for encoding purposes. Since non-ASCII characters require more than one byte for storage, they run the risk of being corrupted if the bytes are separated and not recombined.\n\n## See also\n\n- [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) on Wikipedia\n- [FAQ about UTF-8 on Unicode website](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#UTF8)\n","slug":"1a1bcfe819bc47679acd623371bdca42","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:23.686Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:23.686Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

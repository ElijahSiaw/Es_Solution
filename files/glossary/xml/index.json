{"title":"Xml","tag":"glossary/xml","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\neXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C. The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.\n\nXML tags resemble HTML tags, but XML is much more flexible because it lets users define their own tags. In this way XML acts like a meta-languageâ€”that is, it can be used to define other languages, such as {{Glossary(\"RSS\")}}. Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language. This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can use XML to exchange requests and responses.\n\n## See also\n\n- [XML introduction](/blog/Web/XML/Guides/XML_introduction)\n","slug":"7bda56e25d914ab78231079deae91efd","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:27.777Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:27.777Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

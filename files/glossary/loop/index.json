An example would be the process of getting an item of data and changing it, and then making sure some {{Glossary(\"conditional\", \"condition\")}} is checked â€” such as if a counter has reached a prescribed number.\n\nLoops are one way to execute a statement for a variable number of times. The same effect can be achieved with {{glossary(\"Recursion\", \"recursion\")}}, especially in languages where all data is {{glossary(\"Immutable\", \"immutable\")}}, making it impossible to update a counter variable.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops) on Wikipedia\n- [Loops and iteration guide](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)\n","slug":"ca2e7bad24da42dc94f69be619e6e63b","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.011Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:58.011Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Visual viewport","tag":"glossary/visual_viewport","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nThe portion of the {{Glossary(\"viewport\")}} that is currently visible is called the visual viewport. This can be smaller than the {{Glossary(\"layout viewport\")}}, for example when the user has pinch-zoomed. The visual viewport is the visual portion of a screen excluding on-screen keyboards, areas outside of a pinch-zoom area, and any other on-screen artifact that doesn't scale with the dimensions of a page.\n\n## See also\n\n- {{Glossary(\"Viewport\")}}\n- {{Glossary(\"Layout viewport\")}}\n- [Viewport concepts](/blog/Web/CSS/CSSOM_view/Viewport_concepts)\n- [CSSOM view](/blog/Web/CSS/CSSOM_view) module\n- [Visual Viewport API](/blog/Web/API/Visual_Viewport_API)\n- [Viewport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewport) on Wikipedia\n- [A tale of two viewports](https://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports.html) (Quirksmode)\n","slug":"95f6d50e6fa141f280c2a66a041e4c51","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:24.682Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:24.682Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

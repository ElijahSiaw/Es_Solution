The most common way to achieve this is by ensuring that assistive technologies work properly to access the content. These technologies include {{glossary(\"screen reader\", \"screen readers\")}}, screen magnifiers, speech recognition tools, and alternative input devices.\n\nYou can measure the accessibility of your website by using tools like [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/scoring) and the [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html).\n\nWeb accessibility is formally defined and discussed at the {{Glossary(\"W3C\")}} through the {{Glossary(\"WAI\", \"Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)\")}}.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Accessibility](/blog/Web/Accessibility)\n- [Learn accessibility](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility)\n- [ARIA](/blog/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)\n- [Web accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility) on Wikipedia\n- [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) on W3C\n- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) specification\n- [Web Accessibility In Mind](https://webaim.org/)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"ARIA\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Screen reader\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessibility tree\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessible description\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessible name\")}}\n","slug":"0368fe5656ee4f659eab94097b084de5","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.671Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:48.671Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

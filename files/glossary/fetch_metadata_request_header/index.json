{"title":"Fetch metadata request header","tag":"glossary/fetch_metadata_request_header","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **fetch metadata request header** is an {{Glossary(\"Request header\", \"HTTP request header\")}} that provides additional information about the context from which the request originated. This allows the server to make decisions about whether a request should be allowed based on where the request came from and how the resource will be used.\n\nWith this information a server can implement a resource isolation policy, allowing external sites to request only those resources that are intended for sharing, and that are used appropriately. This approach can help mitigate common cross-site web vulnerabilities such as {{Glossary(\"CSRF\")}}, Cross-site Script Inclusion (XSSI), timing attacks, and cross-origin information leaks.\n\nThese headers are prefixed with `Sec-`, and hence are {{Glossary(\"Forbidden request header\", \"forbidden request headers\")}}. As such, they cannot be modified from JavaScript.\n\nThe fetch metadata request headers are:\n\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Sec-Fetch-Site\")}}\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Sec-Fetch-Mode\")}}\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Sec-Fetch-User\")}}\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Sec-Fetch-Dest\")}}\n\nThe following request headers are not _strictly_ \"fetch metadata request headers\", as they are not in the same specification, but similarly provide information about the context of how a resource will be used.\nA server might use them to modify its caching behavior, or the information that is returned:\n\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Sec-Purpose\")}}\n- {{HTTPHeader(\"Service-Worker-Navigation-Preload\")}}\n\n## See also\n\n- [Protect your resources from web attacks with Fetch Metadata](https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata) (web.dev)\n- [Fetch Metadata Request Headers playground](https://secmetadata.appspot.com/) (secmetadata.appspot.com)\n- [List of all HTTP headers](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers)\n- [List of all HTTP headers > Fetch metadata request headers](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers#fetch_metadata_request_headers)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Representation header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"HTTP_header\",\"HTTP header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Response header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Request header\")}}\n","slug":"a440a321abed463d8d52af0a61a2ea46","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:56.884Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:56.884Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

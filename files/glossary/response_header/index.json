{"title":"Response header","tag":"glossary/response_header","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **response header** is an {{glossary(\"HTTP header\")}} that can be used in an HTTP response and that doesn't relate to the content of the message. Response headers, like {{HTTPHeader(\"Age\")}}, {{HTTPHeader(\"Location\")}} or {{HTTPHeader(\"Server\")}} are used to give a more detailed context of the response.\n\nNot all headers appearing in a response are categorized as _response headers_ by the specification. For example, the {{HTTPHeader(\"Content-Type\")}} header is a {{glossary(\"representation header\")}} indicating the original type of data in the body of the response message (prior to the encoding in the {{HTTPHeader(\"Content-Encoding\")}} representation header being applied). However, \"conversationally\" all headers are usually referred to as response headers in a response message.\n\nThe following shows a few response and representation headers after a {{HTTPMethod(\"GET\")}} request.\n\n```http\n200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 16:06:00 GMT\nEtag: \"c561c68d0ba92bbeb8b0f612a9199f722e3a621a\"\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=997\nLast-Modified: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 02:36:04 GMT\nServer: Apache\nSet-Cookie: my-key=my value; expires=Mon, 17-Jul-2017 16:06:00 GMT; Max-Age=31449600; Path=/; secure\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nVary: Cookie, Accept-Encoding\nX-Backend-Server: developer2.webapp.scl3.mozilla.com\nX-Cache-Info: not cacheable; meta data too large\nX-kuma-revision: 1085259\nx-frame-options: DENY\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [List of all HTTP headers](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Representation header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"HTTP header\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Request header\")}}\n","slug":"077d3bad595c44e1acca73ddd88eefbc","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:11.648Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:11.648Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

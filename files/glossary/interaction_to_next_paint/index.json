There are two key differences between FID and INP that make INP a more reliable measure of a page's responsiveness:\n\n- FID measures only the first user interaction, whereas INP considers all user interactions.\n- FID only measures the input delay of the interaction, whereas INP measures for a longer period: beginning at the input delay, followed by the time it takes to process event handlers, and the browser's presentation time until the browser has painted the next frame.\n\nINP measures the worst length of time (minus some outliers), in milliseconds, between the user interaction on a web page and the next frame presentation after that interaction is processed. Scrolling and zooming are not included in this metric. INP is calculated using the [Event Timing API](/blog/Web/API/PerformanceEventTiming). Asynchronous operations such as network fetches or file reads usually do not delay INP as painting can occur while such operations are handled.\n\nAll eligible interactions throughout the page lifetime are considered. For highly interactive pages of 50 or more interactions, the 98th percentile is used to exclude some extreme outliers that are not reflective of overall page responsiveness.\n\nThe longer the delay, the worse the user experience. The [Long Animation Frames API](/blog/Web/API/Performance_API/Long_animation_frame_timing) can help identify causes of high INP.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Long animation frame timing](/blog/Web/API/Performance_API/Long_animation_frame_timing)\n- [PerformanceEventTiming](/blog/Web/API/PerformanceEventTiming)\n- [INP](https://web.dev/articles/inp) on web.dev (2023)\n- [Optimize Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-inp) on web.dev (2023)\n- [Interaction to Next Paint is officially a Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch) on web.dev (2024)\n","slug":"c0a22e4fe2aa4965a119c43d7d8004bf","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:44.450Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:44.450Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

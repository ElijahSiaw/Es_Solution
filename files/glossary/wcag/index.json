{"title":"Wcag","tag":"glossary/wcag","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n_Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_ (**WCAG**) is a recommendation published by the {{Glossary(\"WAI\",\"Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)\")}} group at the {{Glossary(\"W3C\")}}, outlining a set of guidelines for making content {{glossary(\"accessibility\", \"accessible\")}} primarily for people with disabilities, but also for limited-resource devices and services, such as digital assistants.\n\nWCAG 2 consists of 13 guidelines organized under 4 principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust) and each guideline has testable success criteria.\n\nWCAG 2 uses three levels of conformance:\n\n- Priority 1: Web developers **must** satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as A.\n- Priority 2: Web developers **should** satisfy these requirements, otherwise some groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AA or Double-A.\n- Priority 3: Web developers **may** satisfy these requirements, in order to make it easier for some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AAA or Triple-A.\n\n[WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/) was published on Oct, 2023 and [WCAG 3.0](https://w3c.github.io/wcag3/guidelines/) is in development.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Understanding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](/blog/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Understanding_WCAG)\n- [WCAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines) on Wikipedia\n- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2: Recommendation](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/)\n- [W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0: Working Draft](https://w3c.github.io/wcag3/guidelines/)\n- Glossary\n  - {{Glossary(\"Accessibility\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"WAI\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"ATAG\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"UAAG\")}}\n","slug":"b0d27e5f3e3440d09b7317dfa2ad1f7c","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:25.350Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:25.350Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

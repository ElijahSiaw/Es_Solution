{"title":"Firewall","tag":"glossary/firewall","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **firewall** is a system that filters network traffic. It can either let it pass or block it, according to some specified rules. For example, it can block incoming connections aimed at a certain port or outgoing connections to a certain IP address.\n\nFirewalls can be as simple as a single piece of software, or more complex, like a dedicated machine whose only function is to act as a firewall.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Firewall (computing)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)>) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"20c4260018194e4f8d242ea3b7018c74","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:58.425Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:58.425Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

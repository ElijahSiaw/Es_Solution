{"title":"Semantics","tag":"glossary/semantics","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn programming, **Semantics** refers to the _meaning_ of a piece of code â€” for example \"what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?\", or \"what purpose or role does that HTML element have\" (rather than \"what does it look like?\".)\n\n## Semantics in JavaScript\n\nIn JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an {{htmlelement(\"li\")}} element with that string as its `textContent`. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called `build('Peach')`, or `createLiWithContent('Peach')`?\n\n## Semantics in CSS\n\nIn CSS, consider styling a list with `li` elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with `div > ul > li`, or `.fruits__item`?\n\n## Semantics in HTML\n\nIn HTML, for example, the {{htmlelement(\"Heading_Elements\", \"h1\")}} element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of \"a top level heading on your page.\"\n\n```html\n<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>\n```\n\nBy default, most browser's [user agent stylesheet](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade#user-agent_stylesheets) will style an {{htmlelement(\"Heading_Elements\", \"h1\")}} with a large font size to make it _look_ like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).\n\nOn the other hand, you could make any element _look_ like a top level heading. Consider the following:\n\n```html\n<span style=\"font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;\">Not a top-level heading!</span>\n```\n\nThis will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.\n\nHTML should be coded to represent the _data_ that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of [CSS](/blog/Web/CSS).\n\nSome of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:\n\n- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see {{glossary(\"SEO\")}})\n- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page\n- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless `div`s with or without semantic or namespaced classes\n- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated\n- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming\n\nWhen approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, \"What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?\" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.\n\n## Semantic elements\n\nThese are _some_ of the roughly 100 semantic [elements](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements) available:\n\n- {{htmlelement(\"article\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"aside\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"details\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"figcaption\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"figure\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"footer\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"form\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"header\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"main\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"mark\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"nav\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"section\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"summary\")}}\n- {{htmlelement(\"time\")}}\n\n## See also\n\n- [HTML element reference](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements#inline_text_semantics) on Es Solution\n- [Using HTML sections and outlines](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements#usage_notes) on Es Solution\n- [The meaning of semantics in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics#Computer_science) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"SEO\")}}\n","slug":"72d86d13ddbc475387f1c47e97d3721b","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:14.593Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:14.593Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

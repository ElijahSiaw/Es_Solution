{"title":"Ipv4","tag":"glossary/ipv4","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIPv4 is the fourth version of the communication {{Glossary(\"protocol\")}} underlying the {{glossary(\"Internet\")}} and the first version to be widely deployed.\n\nFirst formalized in 1981, IPv4 traces its roots to the initial development work for ARPAnet. IPv4 is a connectionless protocol to be used on packet-switched Link layer networks (ethernet). {{glossary(\"IPv6\")}} is gradually replacing IPv4 owing to IPv4's security problems and the limitations of its address field. (Version number 5 was assigned in 1979 to the experimental Internet Stream Protocol, which however has never been called IPv5.)\n\n## See also\n\n- [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"98f0448e450d44edbe373ca3505de5ae","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:47.566Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:47.566Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

Some databases, however, don't follow the former mechanism to organized data, which called NoSQL.\n\nSome famous server-side RDBMS are _MySQL_(or _MariaDB_ which is a fork of it), _SQL Server_, and _Oracle Database_. On the other hand, some famous NoSQL examples are _MongoDB_, _Cassandra_, and _Redis_.\n\nBrowsers also have their own database system called {{glossary(\"IndexedDB\")}}.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"IndexedDB\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"SQL\")}}\n","slug":"e7c125b377ac48c79db55a071ae04bb3","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:29.702Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:29.702Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

A state machine reads a set of inputs and changes to a different state based on those inputs.\n\nA state is a description of the status of a system waiting to execute a transition. A transition is a set of actions to execute when a condition is fulfilled or an event received. In a state diagram, circles represent each possible state and arrows represent transitions between states.\n\nLooking at the final state, you can discern something about the series of inputs leading to that state.\n\nThere are two types of basic state machines:\n\n- deterministic finite state machine\n  - : This kind allows only one possible transition for any allowed input. This is like the \"if\" {{Glossary(\"statement\")}} in that `if x then doThis else doThat` is not possible. The computer must perform _one_ of the two options.\n- non-deterministic finite state machine\n  - : Given some state, an input can lead to more than one different state.\n\n_Figure 1: Deterministic Finite State Machine._\n\n![The machine transitions from state 1 to state 2 for input X and from state 1 to state 3 for input Y](statemachine1.png)\n\nIn _Figure 1_, the state begins in State 1; the state changes to State 2 given input 'X', or to State 3 given input 'Y'.\n\n_Figure 2: Non-Deterministic Finite State Machine._\n\n![The machine may remain in state 1, transitioning to itself, or may transition from state 1 to state 2 for input X](statemachine2.png)\n\nIn _Figure 2_, given input 'X', the state can persist or change to State 2.\n\nNote that any {{Glossary(\"regular expression\")}} can be represented by a state machine.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) on Wikipedia\n- [UML state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine) on Wikipedia\n- [Moore machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine) on Wikipedia\n- [Mealy machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"20de9046e1d44a5eab44e2d6f2a45311","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:18.152Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:18.152Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

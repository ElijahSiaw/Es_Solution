{"title":"Ssg","tag":"glossary/ssg","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **static site generator** (SSG) is a software used to generate _static_ websites. A static website is comprised of {{glossary(\"HTML\")}}, {{glossary(\"CSS\")}}, and {{glossary(\"JavaScript\")}} files. Most importantly static sites do not have [server-side logic](/blog/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side), so for any given URL, all users will receive the same content. Authors write content in any form accepted by the generator, such as Markdown, reStructuredText, HTML, (and sometimes even [React](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/React_getting_started), and so on), and the generator compiles them into a set of optimized static files that can be rendered by the browser.\n\nStatic sites are commonly used for blogs, documentation, and other content-driven websites, which don't have data that needs to be fetched or generated server-side. They are fast, secure, and easy to deploy, because they can be served from a {{glossary(\"CDN\")}}.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Introduction to client-side frameworks > static site generators](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Introduction#static_site_generators)\n- [Static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) on Wikipedia\n- [Jamstack site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/)\n- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)\n- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)\n- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)\n- [Astro](https://astro.build/)\n- [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)\n- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)\n","slug":"129efc27a7b44b25b3234922a6902e83","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:17.573Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:17.573Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

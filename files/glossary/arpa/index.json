{"title":"Arpa","tag":"glossary/arpa","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**.arpa** (address and routing parameter area) is a {{glossary(\"TLD\",\"top-level domain\")}} in the Domain Name System (DNS) used for Internet infrastructure purposes, especially reverse DNS lookup (i.e., find the {{glossary('domain name')}} for a given {{glossary(\"IP address\")}}).\n\nThe name came from **ARPA**, currently known as [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA is credited with developing precursors to the Internet ({{glossary(\"ARPANET\")}}), GPS, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. The domain was originally intended only to serve a temporary function for facilitating the systematic naming of the ARPANET computers, but failed to remove it after infrastructural uses had been sanctioned. As a result, the ARPA domain name is a backronym for \"Address and Routing Parameter Area\".\n\n{{glossary(\"TLD\")}} was designed at DARPA during a time when it was called ARPA, hence the `.arpa` domain name.\n\nThe most prominent `.arpa` domains include `in-addr.arpa` and `ip6.arpa`, which provide namespaces for reverse DNS lookup of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses respectively.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"ARPANET\")}}\n- [Official website](https://www.iana.org/domains/arpa)\n- [.arpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"7c3f3ddaa55c4e249c514d76b8a3825d","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.793Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:58:49.793Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

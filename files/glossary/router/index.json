{"title":"Router","tag":"glossary/router","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nThere are three definitions for **routers** on the web:\n\n1. For the network layer, the router is a networking device that decides where to direct {{Glossary('Packet', 'data packets')}}.\n2. For a {{Glossary('SPA', 'Single-page application')}} in the application layer, a router is a library that decides what web page is presented by a given {{Glossary('URL')}}. This middleware module is used for all URL functions, as these are given a path to a file that is rendered to open the next page.\n3. In the implementation of an {{Glossary('API')}} in a service layer, a router is a software component that parses a request and directs or routes the request to various handlers within a program. The router code usually accepts a response from the handler and facilitates its return to the requester.\n\n## See also\n\nFor network layer context:\n\n- [Router (computing)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)>) on Wikipedia\n\nFor SPA in application layer context, most of the popular SPA frameworks have their routing libraries:\n\n- [Angular router](https://angular.dev/guide/routing/common-router-tasks)\n- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/)\n- [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/)\n","slug":"e53a5285d94f429899b89afc3c8bf9ba","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.120Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:12.120Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

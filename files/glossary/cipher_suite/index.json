{"title":"Cipher suite","tag":"glossary/cipher_suite","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Cipher suite** is a combination of a key exchange algorithm, authentication method, bulk encryption {{Glossary(\"cipher\")}}, and message authentication code.\n\nIn a crypto system like {{Glossary(\"TLS\")}}, the client and server must agree on a cipher suite before they can begin communicating securely. A typical cipher suite looks like ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 or ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, indicating:\n\n- ECDHE (elliptic curve Diffieâ€“Hellman ephemeral) for key exchange\n- RSA for authentication\n- AES-128 as the cipher, with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as the block cipher mode of operation\n- SHA-256 as the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC)\n\n## See also\n\n- [Mozilla recommended cipher suite choices for TLS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS)\n","slug":"abc7401fd9c34d268146bb2443fd1c96","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:06.084Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:06.084Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

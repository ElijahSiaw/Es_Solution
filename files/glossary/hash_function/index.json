Hash functions should be quick to compute, and different inputs should as far as possible produce different outputs (this is called _collision-resistance_).\n\nHash functions have both {{glossary(\"cryptography\", \"cryptographic\")}} and non-cryptographic uses. Outside cryptography, for example, hash functions can be used to generate the keys for an associative array such as a map or a dictionary.\n\nThe {{domxref(\"SubtleCrypto.digest()\", \"digest()\")}} function of the {{domxref(\"SubtleCrypto\")}} interface makes various hash functions available to web applications.\n\n## Cryptographic hash functions\n\nIn cryptography, hash functions have many applications, including {{Glossary(\"digital signature\", \"digital signatures\")}}, and {{Glossary(\"HMAC\", \"message authentication codes\")}}.\n\nNot all hash functions are appropriate for cryptography. To be used for cryptography, a hash function must be:\n\n- quick to compute\n- one-way: given the output, it should be impractical or impossible to regenerate the original input\n- tamper-resistant: any change to the input leads to a different output\n- collision-resistant: it should be impractical to find two different inputs that produce the same output\n\nThe hash functions most commonly used in cryptography are from the _SHA-2_ (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family, whose names are `\"SHA-\"` followed by the length of the output digest in bits: for example, `\"SHA-256\"` and `\"SHA-512\"`.\n\nSHA-2 is the successor to the SHA-1 algorithm, which is no longer considered secure and should not be used in cryptography. Note that the MD5 algorithm is also considered insecure.\n\n## See also\n\n- {{domxref(\"SubtleCrypto.digest()\")}}\n- [Hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) on Wikipedia\n- [Cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Symmetric-key cryptography\")}}\n","slug":"4cefeb7294d7411aa9a0f76dd59df295","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:22.238Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:22.239Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

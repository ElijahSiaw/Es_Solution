{"title":"Json type representation","tag":"glossary/json_type_representation","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n{{glossary(\"JSON\")}} is a convenient and widely used format for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null.\n[JSON does not support all data types allowed by JavaScript](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON#javascript_and_json_differences), which means that JavaScript objects that use these incompatible types cannot be directly serialized to JSON.\n\nThe _JSON type representation_ of a JSON-incompatible object is an equivalent JavaScript object with properties encoded such that the information _can_ be serialized to JSON.\nThis typically has the same properties as the original object for compatible data types, while incompatible properties are converted/serialized to compatible types.\nFor example, buffer properties in the original object might be {{Glossary(\"base64\", \"base64url\")}}-encoded to strings in the JSON-type representation.\n\nAn object that cannot automatically be serialized to JSON using the [`JSON.stringify()`](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method can define an instance method named `toJSON()` that returns the _JSON-type representation_ of the original object.\n[`JSON.stringify()`](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) will then use `toJSON()` to get the object to stringify, instead of the original object.\n[`PublicKeyCredential.toJSON()`](/blog/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential/toJSON) and [`Performance.toJSON()`](/blog/Web/API/Performance/toJSON) are examples of this approach.\n\nA JSON string serialized in this way can be deserialized back to the _JSON-type representation_ object using [`JSON.parse()`](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).\nIt is common to provide a converter method, such as {{domxref(\"PublicKeyCredential.parseCreationOptionsFromJSON_static\", \"PublicKeyCredential.parseCreationOptionsFromJSON()\")}}, to convert the _JSON-type representation_ back to the original object.\n","slug":"0a424e8355214abbb44dedd84a6aaabd","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:53.847Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:53.847Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Css","tag":"glossary/css","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the {{glossary(\"browser\")}}.\n\nThe browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.\n\nCSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with {{Glossary(\"HTML\")}} and {{Glossary(\"JavaScript\")}}. CSS usually styles {{Glossary(\"Element\",\"HTML elements\")}}, but can be also used with other markup languages like {{Glossary(\"SVG\")}} or {{Glossary(\"XML\")}}.\n\nA CSS rule is a set of {{Glossary(\"property/CSS\",\"properties\")}} associated with a {{Glossary(\"CSS selector\", \"selector\")}}. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:\n\n```css\n/* The selector \"p\" indicates that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */\np {\n  /* The \"color\" property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */\n  color: yellow;\n\n  /* The \"background-color\" property defines the background color, in this case black. */\n  background-color: black;\n}\n```\n\n\"Cascading\" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Learn CSS](/blog/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics)\n- [The CSS documentation](/blog/Web/CSS)\n- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) on Wikipedia\n- [The CSS Working Group current work](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work)\n","slug":"baf535bc4bdc4ec184f69f6613beaa0a","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:26.101Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:26.101Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

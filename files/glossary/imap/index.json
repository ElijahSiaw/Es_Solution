{"title":"Imap","tag":"glossary/imap","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a {{Glossary(\"protocol\")}} used to retrieve and store emails. More recent than {{Glossary(\"POP\")}}, IMAP allows folders and rules on the server.\n\nUnlike POP3, IMAP allows multiple simultaneous connections to one mailbox. Clients accessing a mailbox can receive information about state changes made from other clients. IMAP also provides a mode for clients to stay connected and receive information on demand.\n\nMark Crispin initially developed IMAP in 1986 as _Interim Mail Access Protocol_. IMAP4 revision 1 is the current version, defined by [RFC 3501](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3501).\n\n## See also\n\n- {{RFC(3501)}}\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"POP\")}}\n- [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"8fdb641cec9b47dbb363b4c4c0d99aa2","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:39.196Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:39.196Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

{"title":"Static method","tag":"glossary/static_method","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA static method (or _static function_) is a {{Glossary(\"method\")}} defined as a member of an {{Glossary(\"object\")}} but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.\n\nIn a [Web API](/blog/Web/API), a static method is one which is defined by an interface but can be called without instantiating an object of that type first.\n\nMethods called on object instances are called _instance methods_.\n\n## Examples\n\nIn the [Notifications API](/blog/Web/API/Notifications_API), the {{domxref(\"Notification/requestPermission_static\", \"Notification.requestPermission()\")}} method is called on the actual {{domxref(\"Notification\")}} constructor itself — it is a static method:\n\n```js\nlet promise = Notification.requestPermission();\n```\n\nThe {{domxref(\"Notification.close()\")}} method on the other hand, is an instance method — it is called on a specific notification object instance to close the system notification it represents:\n\n```js\nlet myNotification = new Notification(\"This is my notification\");\n\nmyNotification.close();\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Static Method](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24034/static-method-java) on Techopedia\n- [static](/blog/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Object\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Method\")}}\n","slug":"2c7cbcfc90244fa8849ebe21a4feacd1","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:18.342Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:18.342Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

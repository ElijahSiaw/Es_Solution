{"title":"Inset properties","tag":"glossary/inset_properties","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nIn CSS, **inset properties** control positioned elements' location by specifying offsets from the elements' default positions. There are physical, logical, and shorthand inset properties.\n\nThe inset properties include the {{cssxref(\"top\")}}, {{cssxref(\"left\")}}, {{cssxref(\"bottom\")}}, and {{cssxref(\"right\")}} physical properties, their {{cssxref(\"inset-block-start\")}}, {{cssxref(\"inset-block-end\")}}, {{cssxref(\"inset-inline-start\")}}, and {{cssxref(\"inset-inline-end\")}} flow-relative {{glossary(\"logical properties\", \"logical property\")}} equivalents, and the {{cssxref(\"inset-block\")}}, {{cssxref(\"inset-inline\")}}, and {{cssxref(\"inset\")}} shorthands.\n\n**Physical properties** reference specific physical sides of an element. Logical properties use directional keywords relative to the block and inline axes. **Block axis** refers to the axis that defines the stacking order of elements in a block layout. The **inline axis** is perpendicular to the block axis, representing the direction along which inline content like text flows within a block. The mapping depends on the element's {{cssxref(\"writing-mode\")}}, {{cssxref(\"direction\")}}, and {{cssxref(\"text-orientation\")}}.\n\nThe interpretation of inset properties depends on the value of the {{cssxref(\"position\")}} property. When `position: absolute` is set, they represent insets from the [containing block](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block) or [anchor element](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using). With `position: relative`, they represent insets from the box's default margin edge position. With `sticky`, they represent insets from the {{glossary(\"scroll container\")}} edge. The `fixed` value is similar to `absolute`, except the element is positioned and sized relative to its fixed positioning containing block, which is often the viewport.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Layout and the containing block](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block)\n- [CSS positioned layout](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout) module\n- [CSS logical properties and values](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values) module\n- [CSS anchor positioning](/blog/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) module\n","slug":"4f880f64bc2b4b98a8d77dfa7b5ae966","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:43.407Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:43.407Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Assigning a function to a variable\n\n```js\nconst foo = () => {\n  console.log(\"foobar\");\n};\nfoo(); // Invoke it using the variable\n// foobar\n```\n\nWe assigned an _Anonymous Function_ in a {{glossary(\"Variable\")}}, then we used that variable to invoke the function by adding parentheses `()` at the end.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Even if your function was named, you can use the variable name to invoke it. Naming it will be helpful when debugging your code. _But it won't affect the way we invoke it._\n\n### Passing a function as an argument\n\n```js\nfunction sayHello() {\n  return \"Hello, \";\n}\nfunction greeting(helloMessage, name) {\n  console.log(helloMessage() + name);\n}\n// Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function\ngreeting(sayHello, \"JavaScript!\");\n// Hello, JavaScript!\n```\n\nWe are passing our `sayHello()` function as an argument to the `greeting()` function, this explains how we are treating the function as a value.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The function that we pass as an argument to another function is called a _{{glossary(\"callback function\")}}_. _`sayHello()` is a callback function._\n\n### Returning a function\n\n```js\nfunction sayHello() {\n  return () => {\n    console.log(\"Hello!\");\n  };\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we are returning a function from another function - _We can return a function because functions in JavaScript are treated as values._\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> A function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments is called a _higher-order function_.\n\n## See also\n\n- [First-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function) on Wikipedia\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{glossary(\"Callback function\")}}\n  - {{glossary(\"Function\")}}\n  - {{glossary(\"Variable\")}}\n","slug":"7c161d3989544da2b8177a9adc196f0e","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:58.940Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:58.940Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

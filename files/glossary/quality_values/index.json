{"title":"Quality values","tag":"glossary/quality_values","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Quality values**, or _q-values_ and _q-factors_, are used to describe the order of priority of values in a comma-separated list. It is a special syntax allowed in some [HTTP headers](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) and in HTML.\n\nThe importance of a value is marked by the suffix `';q='` immediately followed by a value between `0` and `1` included, with up to three decimal digits, the highest value denoting the highest priority. When not present, the default value is `1`.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following syntax\n\n```http\ntext/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\n```\n\nindicates the order of priority:\n\n| Value                                   | Priority |\n| -- | ----- |\n| `text/html` | `0.8` (but totally specified) |\n| `text/*`    | `0.8` (partially specified)   |\n| `*/*`       | `0.8` (not specified)         |\n\nSome syntax, like the one of {{HTTPHeader(\"Accept\")}}, allow additional specifiers like `text/html;level=1`. These increase the specificity of the value. Their use is extremely rare.\n\n## More information\n\n- [HTTP headers](/blog/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) using q-values in their syntax: {{HTTPHeader(\"Accept\")}}, {{HTTPHeader(\"Accept-Encoding\")}}, {{HTTPHeader(\"Accept-Language\")}}, {{HTTPHeader(\"TE\")}}.\n- [Header field definitions.](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)\n","slug":"a19b1f265337477090103507a4021661","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:08.807Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:08.807Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

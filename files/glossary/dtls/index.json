{"title":"Dtls","tag":"glossary/dtls","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Datagram Transport Layer Security** (**DTLS**) is a protocol used to secure datagram-based communications. It's based on the stream-focused Transport Layer Security ({{Glossary(\"TLS\")}}), providing a similar level of security. As a datagram protocol, DTLS doesn't guarantee the order of message delivery, or even that messages will be delivered at all. However, DTLS gains the benefits of datagram protocols, too; in particular, the lower overhead and reduced latency.\n\nThese features are especially useful for one of the most common areas in which DTLS comes into play: {{Glossary(\"WebRTC\")}}. All of the WebRTC related protocols are required to encrypt their communications using DTLS; this includes {{Glossary(\"SCTP\")}}, {{Glossary(\"RTP\", \"SRTP\")}}, and {{Glossary(\"STUN\")}}.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Datagram Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security) on Wikipedia\n- Specifications:\n\n  - {{RFC(9147, \"The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Protocol Version 1.3\")}}\n  - {{RFC(6347, \"Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2\")}}\n\n- Related specification\n\n  - {{RFC(5763, \"Framework for Establishing a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) Security Context Using DTLS\")}}\n  - {{RFC(5764, \"DTLS Extension to Establish Keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)\")}}\n  - {{RFC(6083, \"DTLS for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\")}}\n  - {{RFC(8261, \"Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Encapsulation of SCTP Packets\")}}\n  - {{RFC(7350, \"Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as Transport for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)\")}}\n  - {{RFC(7925, \"TLS / DTLS Profiles for the Internet of Things\")}}\n","slug":"65aee8f1f0354d8d9899ebf2fa1c6e70","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:43.254Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:43.255Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

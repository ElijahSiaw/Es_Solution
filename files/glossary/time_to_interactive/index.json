{"title":"Time to interactive","tag":"glossary/time_to_interactive","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Time to Interactive** (TTI) is a non-standardized web performance 'progress' metric defined as the point in time when the last [Long Task](/blog/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming) finished and was followed by 5 seconds of network and main thread inactivity.\n\nTTI, proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group in 2018, was intended to provide a metric that describes when a page or application contains useful content and the main thread is idle and free to respond to user interactions, including having event handlers registered.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nTTI is derived by leveraging information from the [Long Task API](/blog/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming). Although available in some performance monitoring tools, TTI is not a part of any official web specification.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Definition of TTI](https://github.com/WICG/time-to-interactive) from Web Incubator Community Group\n- [Time to Interactive â€” focusing on human-centric metrics](https://calibreapp.com/blog/time-to-interactive) by Radimir Bitsov\n- {{glossary(\"Time_to_first_byte\", \"Time to first byte (TTFB)\")}}\n","slug":"eb9bd498bf2d4306afbfe23770792660","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.323Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:21.323Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

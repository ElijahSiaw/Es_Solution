{"title":"Kebab case","tag":"glossary/kebab_case","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\n**Kebab case** is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where spaces are replaced with hyphens `-`, and the words are typically all lower case. The name comes from the similarity of the words to meat on a kebab skewer. It's often stylized as \"kebab-case\" to remind the reader of its appearance.\n\nKebab casing is often used as a variable naming convention. However, in many languages, hyphens represent subtraction, so kebab casing is not an option. CSS properties such as {{cssxref(\"background-color\")}} and {{cssxref(\"font-family\")}} are in kebab case, and so are HTML attributes such as [`aria-label`](/blog/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) and [`data-*`](/blog/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/data-*).\n\nKebab-cased words are often simply referred to as _hyphenated_.\n\n## See also\n\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - {{Glossary(\"Camel case\")}}\n  - {{Glossary(\"Snake case\")}}\n- [typescript-eslint rule: `naming-convention`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/naming-convention/)\n","slug":"fe3d05bff28347ac889ed013b374c228","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:00:54.883Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:00:54.884Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

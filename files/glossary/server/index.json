{"title":"Server","tag":"glossary/server","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client. A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center. A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a {{glossary(\"UI\",\"user interface\")}} to human clients.\n\nServices are provided generally over local area networks or wide area networks such as the internet. A client program and server program traditionally connect by passing messages encoded using a {{glossary(\"protocol\")}} over an {{glossary(\"API\")}}.\n\nFor example:\n\n- An Internet-connected Web server is sending a {{glossary(\"HTML\")}} file to your browser software so that you can read this page\n- Local area network server for file, name, mail, print, and fax\n- Minicomputers, mainframes, and super computers at data centers\n\n## See also\n\n- [Introduction to servers](/blog/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_web_server)\n- [Server (computing)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)>) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"8c523f2760ab4b10abc85980d62713c4","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.035Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T10:01:15.035Z","layout":"PostBanner"}

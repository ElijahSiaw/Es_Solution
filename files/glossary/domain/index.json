{"title":"Domain","tag":"glossary/domain","post":"\n\n{{Sidebar(\"Glossary\")}}\n\nA **domain** is an authority within the internet that controls its own resources. Its \"domain name\" is a way to address this authority as part of the hierarchy in a {{Glossary(\"URL\")}} - usually the most memorable part of it, for instance a brand name.\n\nA fully qualified domain name (FQDN) contains all necessary parts to look up this authority by name unambiguously using the {{Glossary(\"DNS\")}} system of the internet.\n\nFor example, in \"developer.mozilla.org\":\n\n1. \"org\" is called a [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). They are registered as an internet standard by the [IANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority). Here, \"org\" means \"organization\" which is defined in a top-level _domain registry_.\n2. \"mozilla\" is the domain. If you like to own a domain you have to register it with one of the many [registrars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) who are allowed to do so with a top-level domain registry.\n3. \"developer\" is a \"sub-domain\", something you as the owner of a domain may define yourself. Many owners choose to have a subdomain \"www\" to point to their {{Glossary(\"World_Wide_Web\")}} resource, but that's not required (and has even fallen somewhat out of favor).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Domain Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) on Wikipedia\n","slug":"0f189e04b51c4bcc831ce6223065105c","authors":"Admin Es Solution","draft":false,"datecreated":"2025-07-05T09:59:39.626Z","dateupdated":"2025-07-05T09:59:39.626Z","layout":"PostBanner"}
